For Die-Hard Mets Fan, a 1,200-Mile Commute
[(Die-Hard Mets Fan, 'ORG'), (1,200-Mile Commute, 'QUANTITY')]
Most sports fans who have moved away from their hometowns are content to follow their favorite team on cable television or the Internet.

So, for nearly every New York Mets homestand over the past four years, Mr. Lee has flown to New York from his adopted home of Kansas City, Mo., to sell cotton candy at the games.

When told that leaving a wife and two children behind to travel nearly 1,200 miles to spend as long as two weeks at a time lugging trays of cotton candy up and down Shea Stadium's concrete stairs, all in the pursuit of a few innings of baseball, is a rather unusual pastime, he shrugs.

In Mr. Lee's version, the conversation went something like this: "She said, "I want to move to the Midwest," and I said, "O.K., but I want to keep my seniority," " he said, referring to the vending position he has held for decades.
[(Lee, 'PERSON'), (Midwest, 'LOC'), (decades, 'DATE')]

As unusual as the Lees" story seems, it was in some ways fated.
[(Lees, 'ORG')]
Mr. Lee's grandfather was an usher at Yankee Stadium for 40 years, starting in 1935 - the year after Babe Ruth left the Yankees, but in an era that included the playing days of Gehrig, DiMaggio, Berra, Mantle, Maris and 16 world championships.

Mr. Lee's father worked as an usher as well, but at the Polo Grounds, which meant he grew up hearing stories about the heroics of the New York Giants" star player Willie Mays.
[(Lee, 'PERSON'), (the Polo Grounds, 'FAC'), (the New York Giants, 'ORG'), (Willie Mays, 'PERSON')]
Mr. Lee's older brother took up the trade, too, albeit briefly, at Shea Stadium, a few miles from the Queens home where the family had moved by that time.
[(Lee, 'PERSON'), (Shea Stadium, 'FAC'), (a few miles, 'QUANTITY'), (Queens, 'GPE')]
Soon after, at 16, Mr. Lee, took up the family business as well.
[(16, 'CARDINAL'), (Lee, 'PERSON')]
As a vendor at Shea, he sold orangeade for 35 cents a cup during baseball season, and hot chocolate during football season.
[(Shea, 'ORG'), (35 cents, 'MONEY')]
During his two years at Queensborough Community College, and then through jobs as a telephone sales representative, a mail carrier and 20 years as a firefighter, Mr. Lee worked at Shea during his off hours, his vending uniforms as subject to the trends of the time as the uniforms worn by the players.
[(his two years, 'DATE'), (Queensborough Community College, 'ORG'), (20 years, 'DATE'), (Lee, 'PERSON'), (Shea, 'ORG'), (his off hours, 'TIME')]
Because the Mets were such a thoroughly rotten club during much of the 1970s and into the early 1980s, the team attracted few fans, which made it particularly tough on vendors, who were sent home if there were not enough people in the stands.
[(Mets, 'ORG'), (the 1970s, 'DATE'), (the early 1980s, 'DATE')]
"I've wasted a lot of time when there were more workers than fans, when you could yell across the stadium and hear an echo," he said.
[]
The arrival of Darryl Strawberry, Dwight Gooden and Hernandez and others made the team a winner, but Mr. Lee acknowledged that selling cotton candy at Shea Stadium might actually be the worst way for a Mets fan to watch a game.
[(Darryl Strawberry, 'PERSON'), (Dwight Gooden, 'PERSON'), (Hernandez, 'ORG'), (Lee, 'PERSON'), (Shea Stadium, 'FAC'), (Mets, 'ORG')]
"If you want to make money, you don't watch the games," he said.

There are times when I leave that I don't even know the score.
[]

[]
Most of the time, he said, he can guess what is going on by the crowd's reactions.
[]
But when a star steps up to the plate, particularly in a critical situation, he turns around and watches along with everyone else because shouting "Cotton candy!
[(Cotton, 'PERSON')]
Get your cotton candy here!" will only irritate people during a game's tense moments.

"Everything's got to stop for those few minutes when those players are up," he said, mentioning the former Mets player Mike Piazza, along with the all-time home run leader Barry Bonds and the former St. Louis Cardinals slugger Mark McGwire.
[(Everything's, 'ORG'), (those few minutes, 'TIME'), (Mets, 'ORG'), (Mike Piazza, 'PERSON'), (Barry Bonds, 'PERSON'), (St. Louis Cardinals, 'ORG'), (Mark McGwire, 'PERSON')]
Mr. Lee says he travels to about 60 of the Mets" 81 home games each season, and sells about 300 sticks of cotton candy on an average night.

Dangers of a Turbocharged Economy
[]
ITS Labor Day weekend, so lets talk about labor.
[(Labor Day weekend, 'DATE')]
Capital absorbs our attention most of the other 364 days of the year.
[(the other 364 days of the year, 'DATE')]
Around 140 million people are employed in the United States.
[(Around 140 million, 'CARDINAL'), (the United States, 'GPE')]
They are engaged in work like governing, manufacturing, health care providing, retailing and researching (as well as suing).
[]
This gigantic army of laborers, argues Robert B. Reich, has morphed into a nation of consumers and investors, rather than citizens. Supercapitalism (Knopf, $25), his 11th book, seeks to explain why this supercharged economic system is a civic problem, and what can be done about it.
[(Robert B. Reich, 'PERSON'), (Knopf, 'ORG'), (25, 'MONEY'), (11th, 'ORDINAL')]
Mr. Reich, who teaches at the University of California, Berkeley, does not rip into opaque hedge funds and demand their regulation.
[(Reich, 'PERSON'), (the University of California, Berkeley, 'ORG')]
Nor does he harp on lax government regulation of credit and mortgage practices.
[]
On the contrary, he criticizes many of the usual liberal fixes directed at the excesses of the market. His book is smart and compelling, if ultimately toothless.
[]
Born in 1946, Mr. Reich served as labor secretary under President Bill Clinton, the avatar of the have-it-all baby boom generation.
[(1946, 'DATE'), (Reich, 'PERSON'), (Bill Clinton, 'PERSON')]
Equally significant, though, is that Mr. Reichs government service dates back to the administrations of Gerald R. Ford and Jimmy Carter  that is, to the 1970s, the decade when Americas immediate postwar economy, a middle-class bonanza like no other, began to give way to todays upper-class bacchanalia.
[(Gerald R. Ford, 'PERSON'), (Jimmy Carter, 'PERSON'), (the 1970s, 'DATE'), (the decade, 'DATE')]
It was during what Mr. Reich aptly calls the Not Quite Golden Age, from 1945 to 1975, that America prospered, income inequality fell and most people trusted in government.
[(Reich, 'PERSON'), (from 1945 to, 'DATE'), (1975, 'DATE'), (America, 'GPE')]
Then, thanks to technologies like shipping containers and the Web, companies suddenly confronted brutal competition.
[]
After that, there was no going back.
[]
Consumers got more choice and lower prices, while the people on Main Street became investors.
[(Main Street, 'FAC')]
Together, newly powerful shoppers and shareholders of this supercapitalism drove a decline in labor unions and a frenzy by corporations desperate to buy some market advantage in Washington.
[(Washington, 'GPE')]
You and I are complicit, Mr. Reich writes.
[(complicit,, 'ORG'), (Reich, 'PERSON')]
Our great deals are somebody elses lower pay and some corporations lobbying.
[]
We are hypocrites, too, he says.
[]
One of the books examples of consumers hypocrisy has to do with canned tuna.
[(One, 'CARDINAL'), (consumers, 'GPE')]
J. W. Connolly, former president of Heinz U.S.A., which was the parent company of StarKist, explains that consumers wanted a dolphin-safe product, but if there was a dolphin-safe can of tuna next to a regular can, people chose the cheaper product.
[(J. W. Connolly, 'PERSON'), (Heinz U.S.A., 'ORG'), (StarKist, 'ORG')]
Even if the difference was a penny. The company terminated its higher-cost effort to protect dolphins.
[]
After all, its a business, beholden to consumers and shareholders.
[(beholden, 'GPE')]
With such vignettes culled from the news media, Mr. Reich disembowels proponents of corporate social responsibility. He shows that companies like Wal-Mart are operating legally yet being shamed into incurring social costs that their competitors are not.
[(Reich, 'PERSON'), (Wal-Mart, 'ORG')]
Critics campaigns are a misleading diversion, he argues, because they confuse businesses with what they can never be: public interest bodies.
[(Critics, 'PRODUCT')]
Public-relations skirmishes are no substitute for democracy.
[]
The ritual scolding of corporations in front of Congressional committees, Mr. Reich says, goes hand in hand with Congresss failure to pass follow-up laws that reward businesses for safeguarding the environment or walking away from deals with serial human rights abusers.
[(Reich, 'PERSON'), (Congresss, 'ORG')]
Washington is all about the money, he writes.
[(Washington, 'GPE')]
In 2005, the Census Bureau listed seven suburban counties around the capital as among the 20 richest in the country.
[(2005, 'DATE'), (the Census Bureau, 'ORG'), (seven, 'CARDINAL'), (20, 'CARDINAL')]
And its not just Republicans cashing in on their service. Upon leaving office, he notes, more than half of the senior officials in the Clinton administration became corporate lobbyists.
[(Republicans, 'NORP'), (office,, 'ORG'), (more than half, 'CARDINAL'), (Clinton, 'PERSON')]
Would-be analysts of this trend, Mr. Reich says, have it backward; government is not historically bigger now, relative to gross domestic product, and politicians are not more corrupt.
[(Reich, 'PERSON')]
Rather, market competition is greater, which means that public policy contests  over organic labeling, for example  have more than ever become just brawls among business rivals.
[]
Here, however, we arrive at a cul-de-sac.
[]
Mr. Reich argues that the most effective thing reformers could do is to reduce the effects of corporate money on politics and enhance the voices of citizens. But he also writes of the lock that corporations have and how the system cannot repair itself from the inside.
[(Reich, 'PERSON')]
So he opts for consciousness-raising.
[]
The public and the media, he writes, must understand the obscured truths laid bare in his book and demand change.
[]
In passing, Mr. Reich comes out in favor of decoupling health insurance from employers and raising the minimum wage to about half the average workers wage.
[(Reich, 'PERSON'), (about half, 'CARDINAL')]
He mentions runaway C.E.O. pay but offers no prescriptions.
[(C.E.O., 'ORG')]
Capping executive compensation is liable to be rejected as un-American, which it is.
[(Capping, 'ORG'), (un-American, 'NORP')]
So heres my suggestion: a legally binding maximum on C.E.O. multiples of their own workers salaries.
[(C.E.O., 'ORG')]
Lets pick a multiple of 300, well above the historical average.
[(300, 'CARDINAL')]
If chief executives want to be paid hundreds of millions, and boards comply, no problem; the C.E.O.s task would be to figure out how to pay the companys lowest worker hundreds of thousands.
[(hundreds of millions, 'CARDINAL'), (hundreds of thousands, 'CARDINAL')]
That would be supercapitalism.
[]
Chief executives could devote their formidable talents to raising the skills and living standards of loyal work forces and avoiding the huge self-imposed costs of labor turnover, rather than gaming quarterly reports.
[(quarterly, 'DATE')]
Shareholders would remain empowered to invest or divest based on performance.
[]
A lot of American businesses are already well in line with the proposed pay multiple.
[(American, 'NORP')]
Companies that insist that they could never compete under the mandated guideline would have an option: look abroad for a cheaper C.E.O.
[(C.E.O., 'ORG')]
To provide an incentive, Congress could enact one of Mr. Reichs best-argued proposals: elimination of the corporate income tax.
[(Congress, 'ORG'), (one, 'CARDINAL')]
But only for companies in compliance with the pay-scale multiple.

Happy Labor Day.

6 - Eleven current or former public officials, including two members of the State Assembly, were charged Thursday with taking thousands of dollars in bribes in exchange for promising municipal business to undercover officers posing as insurance brokers in the latest federal probe into New Jersey's rampant political corruption.
[(two, 'CARDINAL'), (the State Assembly, 'ORG'), (Thursday, 'DATE'), (thousands of dollars, 'MONEY'), (New Jersey's, 'GPE')]
The officials, and a man affiliated with one of them, were rounded up by agents with the Federal Bureau of Investigation early Thursday morning and appeared before a judge in Federal District Court here by afternoon.
[(one, 'CARDINAL'), (the Federal Bureau of Investigation, 'ORG'), (Thursday, 'DATE'), (morning, 'TIME'), (Federal District Court, 'ORG'), (afternoon, 'TIME')]
The arrests culminated an 18-month investigation in which an undercover agent and cooperating witnesses posed as insurance brokers and traded wads of cash ranging from $1,500 to $17,500 for assurances of votes on school boards and city councils.
[(18-month, 'DATE'), ($1,500 to $17,500, 'MONEY')]
The investigation initially focused on the Pleasantville Board of Education, which runs a tiny, impoverished school district near Atlantic City.
[(the Pleasantville Board of Education, 'ORG'), (Atlantic City, 'GPE')]
With 13 superintendents in the last 10 years, the district has been plagued by turmoil and is now working with a state-appointed monitor.
[(13, 'CARDINAL'), (the last 10 years, 'DATE')]
But then, unexpectedly, Pleasantville officials led federal investigators on what Christopher J. Christie, the United States attorney for New Jersey, described at a news conference here as a "corruption tour" of New Jersey by referring the fake insurers to other parts of the state.
[(Pleasantville, 'GPE'), (Christopher J. Christie, 'PERSON'), (United States, 'GPE'), (New Jersey, 'GPE'), (New Jersey, 'GPE')]
That tour, prosecutors said, ranged 125 miles north to Passaic and Paterson, two gritty towns just outside New York City known for rough politics, as well as to Newark and Orange.
[(125 miles, 'QUANTITY'), (Paterson, 'PERSON'), (two, 'CARDINAL'), (New York City, 'GPE'), (Newark, 'GPE'), (Orange, 'GPE')]

Two powerful Democratic veterans - Sharpe James, the former mayor of Newark, and Wayne R.

But even Mr. Christie said that he was stunned by the business-as-usual boldness uncovered in the most recent investigation, which the F.B.I. dubbed Operation Broken Boards.
[(Christie, 'PERSON')]
Mr. Christie noted that one of those charged, Assemblyman Mims Hackett Jr., is the chairman of the State Government Committee, which is responsible for government rules and oversight, including ethics legislation.
[(Christie, 'PERSON'), (one, 'CARDINAL'), (Mims Hackett Jr., 'PERSON'), (the State Government Committee, 'ORG')]
"It's been six years doing this job, and I thought I could no longer be surprised by a combination of brazenness, arrogance and stupidity," Mr. Christie said.
[(six years, 'DATE'), (Christie, 'PERSON')]
But the people elected in this state continue to defy description.

Along with Mr. Hackett, who is also the mayor of Orange, the highest-ranking person arrested was Assemblyman Alfred E. Steele, who is also a Baptist minister and an undersheriff in Passaic County.
[(Hackett, 'PERSON'), (Orange, 'ORG'), (Alfred E. Steele, 'PERSON'), (Baptist, 'PRODUCT'), (Passaic County, 'GPE')]
Both hold leadership posts in the Democratic-controlled Assembly.
[(Democratic, 'NORP'), (Assembly, 'ORG')]
Federal investigators also arrested Mayor Samuel Rivera of Passaic, who resigned Thursday from a committee of mayors supporting Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton's presidential bid.
[(Samuel Rivera, 'PERSON'), (Thursday, 'DATE'), (Hillary Rodham Clinton's, 'PERSON')]
Mr. Rivera, a former police officer in both New Jersey and Puerto Rico, has had a variety of run-ins with law enforcement, including domestic violence charges filed by his daughter in 2004 that were later dropped; charges in 2002 of making terroristic threats against a boxer who had gone to the home of a woman Mr. Rivera later married (also dropped); and a 2003 assault conviction for yelling obscenities at a woman and pushing her.
[(Rivera, 'PERSON'), (New Jersey, 'GPE'), (Puerto Rico, 'GPE'), (2004, 'DATE'), (2002, 'DATE'), (Rivera, 'PERSON'), (2003, 'DATE')]

[(1966, 'DATE'), (20-year-old, 'DATE'), (Rivera, 'PERSON')]
And then there was Keith O. Reid, chief of staff to the president of the Newark Municipal Council, who told the undercover investigators that he was the "offensive coordinator" in the city and could make even the quarterbacks get in line.
[(Keith O. Reid, 'PERSON'), (the Newark Municipal Council, 'ORG')]
"So, therefore, I get to say, "That's not the play we're running," " Mr. Reid told the agents, according to court records.
[(Reid, 'PERSON')]
This is the play we're running.
[]
As for those arrested, the general response to reporters" questions at the federal courthouse in Trenton was no comment.
[(Trenton, 'GPE')]
Mr. Steele even ran away, literally, from hordes of reporters chasing him through downtown Trenton, causing rush-hour traffic to halt.
[(Steele, 'PERSON'), (Trenton, 'GPE')]
One person who did say a few things, though, was Mr. Rivera, who suggested in Spanish that Hispanics had always been unfairly targeted.
[(One, 'CARDINAL'), (Rivera, 'PERSON'), (Spanish, 'NORP'), (Hispanics, 'NORP')]
"Siempre," Mr. Rivera said, which means "always," before adding in English later, "I'll have my day in court."
[(Siempre, 'PERSON'), (Rivera, 'PERSON'), (English, 'LANGUAGE')]
The arrests come two days after Gov. Jon S. Corzine signed a package of ethics bills limiting the ability of state lawmakers to hold local posts, which critics say has led to much corruption.
[(two days, 'DATE'), (Jon S. Corzine, 'PERSON')]
They also coincide with the state's Democratic convention, being held in Atlantic City, prompting renewed accusations that Mr. Christie, an ambitious Republican who is mentioned as a likely candidate for governor in 2009, factors politics into the timing of his announcements.
[(Democratic, 'NORP'), (Atlantic City, 'GPE'), (Christie, 'PERSON'), (Republican, 'NORP'), (2009, 'DATE')]
Mr. Christie denied that, as he has at every news conference announcing arrests related to political corruption.
[(Christie, 'PERSON')]
He noted that one of the key players arrested, Jonathan Soto, a former city councilman in Passaic, was a Republican, and insisted that law enforcement considerations alone determined the timing of arrests.
[(Jonathan Soto, 'PERSON'), (Passaic, 'ORG'), (Republican, 'NORP')]
"We never consider politics in those considerations," he said.
[]
It's an old song by people who are trying to defend criminals.
[]
The complaints are based, in part, on hundreds of tape-recorded and videotaped encounters - including some as recent as last week - during which the officials are accused of boasting that they could use their positions to help get insurance and roofing contracts for the undercover agents.
[(hundreds, 'CARDINAL'), (last week, 'DATE')]
And in both Pleasantville and Passaic, they delivered on their promises, as the school board and City Council passed resolutions helpful to the fictitious insurance business, the complaints say.
[(Pleasantville, 'GPE'), (City Council, 'ORG')]
Indeed, Mr. Rivera, in exchange for $5,000, declared in an expletive-laced claim on Aug. 29, according to the complaints: "I make the decision.
[(Rivera, 'PERSON'), (5,000, 'MONEY'), (Aug. 29, 'DATE')]

Oppenheimer is the Yankees scouting director now, and Lynns tale was instructive in deciding whom to take with the Yankees first-round pick in last summers draft.
[(Oppenheimer, 'ORG'), (Yankees, 'PRODUCT'), (Yankees first-round, 'DATE')]
Ian Kennedy, a U.S.C. right-hander, had slumped to a 5-7 record and a 3.90 earned run average as a junior.
[(Ian Kennedy, 'PERSON'), (5, 'CARDINAL'), (3.90, 'CARDINAL')]
But various publications had named him a first-team all-American as a sophomore, and that was the pitcher Oppenheimer wanted.
[(first, 'ORDINAL'), (all-American, 'NORP'), (Oppenheimer, 'ORG')]
So when the Yankees turn came with the 21st overall pick in 2006, Oppenheimer chose Kennedy and let Brian Cashman, the general manager, work out a $2.25 million bonus with Kennedys agent, Scott Boras.

Like Lynn, Kennedy reached the majors in September of the year after he was drafted.

Kennedy has been compared with Mussina; each commands the low fastball at his best.
[(Kennedy, 'PERSON'), (Mussina, 'GPE')]
But Kennedys top off-speed pitch is the changeup, with his curveball still developing, and he is short for a right-handed pitcher.
[(Kennedys, 'NORP')]
For a guy whos right around six feet, he still gets a good plane on his fastball; its all downhill, Oppenheimer said. It seems kind of strange, but he gets way out on his front side, so it seems like hes closer to the plate.

To Jeff Clement, who made his debut for the Seattle Mariners on Tuesday, Kennedys quick rise was predictable.

Kennedy also stood out when he pitched for Team U.S.A. against hitters with wood bats.

When Kennedy slipped as a junior, Oppenheimer noticed that he did not seem as comfortable with his catcher as he had with Clement.

ABC Reopens Investigation, Again Wary of a Reporter
[(ABC Reopens Investigation, 'ORG')]
ABC News said yesterday that it would begin a second investigation into more than five years of news reports that relied on information from a consultant, Alexis Debat, who has been revealed to be the author of faked interviews.
[(ABC News, 'ORG'), (yesterday, 'DATE'), (second, 'ORDINAL'), (more than five years, 'DATE'), (Alexis Debat, 'PERSON')]
The interviews, published in a French journal, were said to have been done with prominent political figures, including former President Bill Clinton and Senator Barack Obama.
[(French, 'NORP'), (Bill Clinton, 'PERSON'), (Barack Obama, 'PERSON')]
We going at this again with a vengeance, said Brian Ross, the ABC correspondent who was involved in most of the reports that used information provided by Mr. Debat, whom ABC hired in November 2001.
[(Brian Ross, 'PERSON'), (ABC, 'ORG'), (Debat, 'PERSON'), (ABC, 'ORG'), (November 2001, 'DATE')]
ABC fired Mr. Debat in June after discovering that his claims of having earned a doctorate from the Sorbonne were false.
[(ABC, 'ORG'), (Debat, 'PERSON'), (June, 'DATE'), (Sorbonne, 'ORG')]
The network then investigated the reports Mr. Debat had participated in and found they absolutely checked out, Mr. Ross said.
[(Debat, 'PERSON'), (Ross, 'PERSON')]
Now, however, ABC is taking a further look into information Mr. Debat provided.
[(ABC, 'ORG'), (Debat, 'PERSON')]
Mr. Ross said ABC had dispatched an investigator to Pakistan to go over details of reports in which Mr. Debat provided information.
[(Ross, 'PERSON'), (ABC, 'ORG'), (Pakistan, 'GPE'), (Debat, 'PERSON')]
At the same time, The Associated Press reported last night that it also was investigating three news reports that relied on Mr. Debat for information.
[(The Associated Press, 'ORG'), (last night, 'TIME'), (three, 'CARDINAL'), (Debat, 'PERSON')]
The renewed scrutiny has been driven by revelations about Mr. Debat after a French news Web site, Rue 89, reported this week that an interview supposedly with Senator Obama was entirely made up.
[(Debat, 'PERSON'), (French, 'NORP'), (Rue 89, 'LAW'), (this week, 'DATE'), (Obama, 'PERSON')]
Mr. Debat, who could not be reached last night, sent an e-mail message to ABC yesterday saying the allegations against him are slanderous.

He told The Washington Post Wednesday that an intermediary had spoken with Mr. Obama.

But representatives for Mr. Obama denied that he spoke with anyone connected to Mr. Debat.

Subsequently, other figures whose interviews appeared under Mr. Debats byline in the French magazine Politique Internationale have come forward to say they never spoke to him.
[(Debats, 'PERSON'), (French, 'NORP'), (Politique Internationale, 'ORG')]
These included Mr. Clinton; Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg; Alan Greenspan, the former Federal Reserve chairman; Bill Gates, the chairman of Microsoft; and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

When representatives from the states Department of Public Health and the Department of Children and Families showed up last month at the day care center, which Collette A.

The success of Nike+ is bad news for the traditional media companies that have long made money from Nikes television commercials and glossy magazine ads.
[(Nike+, 'ORG')]
Last year, Nike spent just 33 percent of its $678 million United States advertising budget on ads with television networks and other traditional media companies.
[(Last year, 'DATE'), (Nike, 'ORG'), (just 33 percent, 'PERCENT'), ($678 million, 'MONEY'), (United States, 'GPE')]
Thats down from 55 percent 10 years ago, according to the trade publication Advertising Age.

[(Edwards, 'PERSON')]
Mr. Edwards may be more blunt than most.
[(Edwards, 'PERSON')]
But many large marketers are taking huge chunks of money out of their budgets for traditional media and using the funds to develop new, more direct interactions with consumers  not only on the Internet, but also through in-person events.
[]
Adventurous companies like Nike have been experimenting with these alternatives since the 1990s.
[(Nike, 'ORG'), (the 1990s, 'DATE')]
But now, even the most conventional marketers are making these alternatives a permanent  and ever bigger  part of their advertising budgets.

Nike executives say that much of the companys future advertising spending will take the form of services for consumers, like workout advice, online communities and local sports competitions.
[(Nike, 'ORG')]
We want to find a way to enhance the experience and services, rather than looking for a way to interrupt people from getting to where they want to go, said Stefan Olander, global director for brand connections at Nike. How can we provide a service that the consumer goes, Wow, you really made this easier for me?
[(Stefan Olander, 'PERSON'), (Nike, 'ORG'), (Wow, 'PERSON')]

Traditionally, the service provided by advertising was cheaper media content for consumers.

But the services of the future may be virtual workout coaches, map applications for cellphones, health advice and matchmaking services.

Nike executives portray the shift in strategy as a return to the companys roots in the 1970s, when, in the words of an early magazine ad, Nike grew through word-of-foot marketing. In the early days, Nike displayed posters from local races in stores and was host for local runs on the West Coast.

They include alarm and motion-detection systems, modern gates, guardhouses and fighting positions, as well as detectors for explosives, radiation and metal.

The programs completion ahead of schedule appeared to have political as well as security significance at a time when relations between the countries have been strained.

Two American nonproliferation officials said the new round of nuclear security upgrades shows that even in times of renewed tension between Washington and the Kremlin, American teams have been working closely with Russian officials at some of the countrys most classified sites.

Mr. Tobey and another official at the security administration, a semiautonomous arm of the Department of Energy, declined to provide many details of the final inspection and work, saying that under the agreement with Russia many elements of the program remain classified.

"Yes!" answered the girls, all in skirts and summer dresses, headbands and heels, who had come to this anti-violence gathering called Defining Our Own Destiny Forum.
[(summer, 'DATE'), (Defining Our Own Destiny Forum, 'WORK_OF_ART')]
Then Brown added, ever so slyly, "There might be a surprise tonight."
[(Brown, 'PERSON'), (tonight, 'TIME')]
"Tickets!" a few girls shouted.
[]
Brown just smiled.
[]
And held the smile, with some effort, for a few hours.
[(a few hours, 'TIME')]
At 4:45 p.m., Brown told them they were getting concert tickets.
[(4:45 p.m., 'TIME'), (Brown, 'PERSON')]
At 5 p.m., they were listening to speeches.
[(5 p.m., 'TIME')]
At 7:10 p.m., Brown told the girls to put away their camera cellphones and stay in their seats.

[(20 minutes, 'TIME')]
At 7:30, the concert began.
[(7:30, 'TIME')]
The girls were still waiting.

Finally, shortly after 7:45, the door opened and in walked Beyonce, clad in silver high heels, skinny jeans and a gray blouse and sporting Barbie-doll hair.
[(7:45, 'TIME'), (Beyonce, 'GPE'), (Barbie, 'PERSON')]
There was a smattering of cheers from the visibly bored crowd.
[]
For the next 15 minutes or so, Beyonce shook hands and engaged in chitchat, posing with the girls in groups of 10 as a photographer in her entourage snapped pictures.
[(the next 15 minutes, 'TIME'), (10, 'CARDINAL')]
Media and Verizon Center photographers were banned from taking her picture, though.
[(Verizon Center, 'ORG')]
But her brief, late appearance was a far cry from what Brown had hoped for: a few choice words from a role model on healthy eating and living.
[(Brown, 'PERSON')]
That's why Brown invited her: "She promotes young girls loving themselves," he said.
[(Brown, 'PERSON')]
By 8, all the girls had left for the concert.
[(8, 'DATE')]
Beyonce stayed behind, waiting for her cue to go onstage.
[]
The forum for girls -- and Beyonce's brief appearance -- was orchestrated by Brown and his staff members as a counterweight to the many anti-violence programs in the city for teenage boys.
[(Brown, 'PERSON')]
The forum was devoted to stopping violence in the girls' troubled neighborhoods and spreading the message that they can overcome any challenges.
[]
Organizations that participated included Covenant House Washington, Peaceoholics/C.H.O.I.C.E. and the Mayor's Youth Leadership Institute.
[(Washington, 'GPE'), (Youth Leadership Institute, 'ORG')]
The forum featured presentations on perseverance despite obstacles, maintaining a healthy self-image and trying to become a peacemaker in the community.

The girls came from across the city -- from such neighborhoods and public housing projects as Anacostia, Sursum Corda, Trenton Park, Kenilworth, Barry Farms, Bruce Place, Trinidad, Columbia Heights and Garfield Heights.

The two younger Callahans once typified the kind of girls that Brown most worries about.
[(two, 'CARDINAL'), (Callahans, 'NORP'), (Brown, 'PERSON')]
They were members of Choppa City, the Southeast Washington gang named for a type of gun, Madina said.
[(Choppa City, 'GPE'), (Washington, 'GPE'), (Madina, 'PERSON')]
"I was always fighting," she said.
[]
"Before I met Peaceoholics, I was the type that you wouldn't see here," she said, sitting in a room reached by a private elevator, named for an expensive train and overlooking the stage.
[]
"I was not peace and quiet," Madina continues.
[(Madina, 'PERSON')]
When we fought someone, we thought it was fun.
[]
She stops.
[]
This is how she used to think.
[]
But that was being immature, and we weren't thinking about the other side.
[]
She began thinking about the other side in the spring of last year, after Peaceoholics made overtures to the Choppa City girls.
[(the spring of last year, 'DATE'), (Choppa City, 'GPE')]
The group also made the girls think about a future that included college.
[]
"I wanted to go to college, but I never thought I'd be able to say, 'I'm going to college,' " Melvina said.
[(Melvina, 'GPE')]
Said Madina: "I wanted to go to college, but there's a lot of things you want and you're never gonna get."

"We have so much youth violence in this city," he said. "

A Colorful Nickname Often Leads to a Criminal's Capture

SACRAMENTO -- The Spiderman Bandit didn't scale walls and spin webs while robbing banks.
[(SACRAMENTO, 'GPE')]
Rather, weblike tattoos on his forearms earned him the nickname.
[]
The Skunk Bandit probably doesn't stink -- at least not like a skunk.
[]
He does, however, resemble a skunk in bank surveillance video, in his black shirt, black pants and white tie.
[]
The Ponytail Bandit, well, does wear a ponytail.
[(The Ponytail Bandit, 'ORG')]
And Grandpa Bandit is an older man, clearly more senior than most bank robbers.
[(Grandpa Bandit, 'PERSON')]
Although lighthearted monikers for serial bank robbers can sound flippant, they are actually more functional than fun.
[]
By coining memorable nicknames for serial criminals, law enforcement officials are increasing the odds that crooks will be caught.
[]
In other words, FBI agents say, the practice amounts to an effective law enforcement tool.
[(FBI, 'ORG')]
Identifying, colorful and quirky nicknames generate more news coverage, more public interest, more tips and more opportunities to apprehend culprits quickly, FBI agents say.
[(FBI, 'ORG')]
By planting a mind picture in those who follow the news, they make it more likely criminals will be spotted and reported.
[]
"Nicknames are wordplay that captivates people's imaginations," said sociology professor Paul Leslie at Greensboro College in North Carolina.
[(Paul Leslie, 'PERSON'), (Greensboro College, 'ORG'), (North Carolina, 'GPE')]
Seems like the FBI may have hit onto something.
[(FBI, 'ORG')]
Bill Rehder, who became the FBI's bank robbery coordinator in Los Angeles in 1981, was the one who decided that bandits get code names as soon as they hit a second bank.
[(Bill Rehder, 'PERSON'), (FBI, 'ORG'), (Los Angeles, 'GPE'), (1981, 'DATE'), (second, 'ORDINAL')]
Rehder, who retired from the agency in 1999, said the practice was used infrequently before he formalized the naming convention.
[(1999, 'DATE')]
Rehder spent most of his 33 years with the FBI on the bank robbery squad.
[(Rehder, 'NORP'), (his 33 years, 'DATE'), (FBI, 'ORG')]
He was co-author of the book "Where the Money Is: True Tales From the Bank Robbery Capital of the World."
[("Where the Money Is: True Tales From the Bank Robbery Capital of the World, 'WORK_OF_ART')]
Rehder said that the tradition of assigning memorable monikers to criminals goes way back.
[(Rehder, 'ORG')]
"The nicknaming system could be traced back to Jack the Ripper, probably the most famous of all," he said.
[(Jack the Ripper, 'PERSON')]
That was probably the most interesting and imaginative code name in criminal history.
[]
It was also apt, because it described what he was doing -- killing and mutilating prostitutes in late-19th-century England, Rehder said.
[(England, 'GPE'), (Rehder, 'ORG')]
"Had they called him Prostitute Killer Number 104, no one would have remembered," Rehder said.
[(Prostitute Killer Number 104, 'PERSON'), (Rehder, 'ORG')]
Modern-day California has had its fair share of diabolical, blood-curdling nicknames for serial murderers: the Thrill Killer, who killed six people on two consecutive Tuesdays in 1991; and the Vampire Killer, who drank some of his victims' blood after killing them in December 1977 and January 1978.
[(Modern-day, 'DATE'), (California, 'GPE'), (the Thrill Killer, 'ORG'), (six, 'CARDINAL'), (two consecutive Tuesdays, 'DATE'), (1991, 'DATE'), (the Vampire Killer, 'ORG'), (December 1977, 'DATE'), (January 1978, 'DATE')]
Retired Lt. Ray Biondi of the Sacramento County Sheriff's Department wasn't quite sure who came up with the latter's nickname.
[(Ray Biondi, 'PERSON')]
But he recalled a reporter asking him about the motive for murder in the Thrill Killer case.
[(Thrill Killer, 'PERSON')]
His answer -- that the killer was doing it for the thrill of it -- led the news account the next day.
[(the next day, 'DATE')]
"The media is sometimes more informative and creative about that," Biondi said.
[(Biondi, 'PERSON')]
You guys usually come up with a catchy headline.
[]
Nicknames can create a sense of familiarity with a person, Leslie said.
[(Leslie, 'PERSON')]
But when it comes to criminals, catchy titles make the subject perversely intriguing, he said.
[]
The names also drive home the point that the person's act is aberrant, immoral and unethical.
[]
"It makes that person stand out for negative reasons," Leslie said.
[(Leslie, 'PERSON')]
Agents derive a nickname from suspects' appearance, their attire, their modus operandi, areas where they rob, or idiosyncratic habits, said Special Agent Marcus Knutson.
[(Special Agent Marcus Knutson, 'ORG')]
Sometimes the nickname highlights an unflattering feature.
[]
Imagine going down in the annals of criminal history as the Big Nose Bandit, the Big Ears Bandit or Miss Piggy, which was the fate suffered by some Southern Californian robbers, thanks to Rehder.
[(the Big Nose Bandit, 'ORG'), (Miss Piggy, 'PERSON'), (Southern Californian, 'NORP'), (Rehder, 'NORP')]
In fact, a man with a bad case of acne, dubbed the Clearasil Bandit, was so offended he tried to sue the bureau.
[(the Clearasil Bandit, 'ORG')]
He alleged he was being taunted by other inmates while incarcerated, Rehder said.
[(Rehder, 'ORG')]
Besides generating publicity, the monikers help the FBI and the local law enforcement agencies keep track of serial bank robbers they have not identified, said Special Agent Doug Cook.
[(FBI, 'ORG'), (Doug Cook, 'PERSON')]
A code name immediately links descriptions and background information to a suspect.

As he stood on a platform, taking in his world, it was hard to ignore the irony: For the past two years, a good chunk of "The Wire," the HBO show that critics have praised for the grittiness of its inner-city v?rit?, has been filmed in an anonymous soundstage in the burbs -- a soundstage that reportedly will be turned into a massive Wegmans Food Market.

Simon, who once covered cops for the Baltimore Sun, always knew that "The Wire" would end at exactly this point.
[(the Baltimore Sun, 'ORG'), (The Wire, 'WORK_OF_ART')]
From the beginning when the show debuted in 2002, he saw it as a visual novel, with each season a distinct chapter exploring an aspect of inner-city life: The first season examined the drug trade; the second focused on Baltimore's longshoremen; the third grappled with politics and the notion of reform; the fourth dug into education and the lives of the city's children.
[(2002, 'DATE'), (each season, 'DATE'), (The first season, 'DATE'), (second, 'ORDINAL'), (Baltimore, 'GPE'), (third, 'ORDINAL'), (fourth, 'ORDINAL')]

[(This season, 'DATE'), (Jan. 6, 'DATE'), (Tom McCarthy, 'PERSON'), (The Station Agent, 'WORK_OF_ART')]
"The Wire" has always struggled in the ratings; last season it averaged 1.6 million viewers per episode.

But it's always enjoyed the admiration of critics, who praised it as being the "most authentic epic ever on television."

Notwithstanding the giant soundstage, a good 50 percent of the show was shot on location in Baltimore, with real-life characters frequently sprinkled in with the fictional ones.

SAN DIEGO -- Padres left fielder Milton Bradley tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee when he was spun to the ground by his manager Sunday during a blowup with an umpire and will miss the rest of the season.
[(SAN DIEGO, 'NORP'), (Milton Bradley, 'PERSON'), (Sunday, 'DATE')]
The diagnosis came from an MRI exam, according to a person with knowledge of the situation, who spoke Monday on condition of anonymity because a formal announcement had yet to be made.
[(Monday, 'DATE')]
Bradley, who helped spark the wild-card leading Padres during the season's second half, was ejected by Mike Winters.
[(Bradley, 'ORG'), (the season's second half, 'DATE'), (Mike Winters, 'PERSON')]
He then hurt his knee during a bizarre scene when manager Bud Black spun him to the ground to keep him from going after the first base umpire in the eighth inning of Sunday's 7-3 loss to Colorado.

The Padres were incredulous after Sunday's game, saying Winters baited Bradley, leading to the confrontation.

Bradley, whose volatile temper has overshadowed his talent during his career, called it "the most unprofessional and most ridiculous thing I've ever seen."

[(Bradley, 'ORG'), (Sunday, 'DATE')]

Batting .313, Bradley hit his 11th homer earlier in the game.
[(.313, 'CARDINAL'), (Bradley, 'ORG'), (11th, 'ORDINAL')]
As Bradley walked to the plate in the eighth, umpire Brian Runge asked the player if he had flipped his bat in the ump's direction after taking a called third strike to end the fifth.

INDIANAPOLIS -- The Indianapolis Colts took Denver's best shot Sunday, and the Broncos couldn't knock out the defending champions.
[(The Indianapolis Colts, 'ORG'), (Denver, 'GPE'), (Sunday, 'DATE'), (Broncos, 'PRODUCT')]
Indianapolis (4-0) relied on flawless execution to score on six of its last eight possessions in a 38-20 victory, adding yet another anguishing chapter to the Broncos recent rivalry with Indy.
[(Indianapolis, 'GPE'), (4, 'CARDINAL'), (six, 'CARDINAL'), (last eight, 'DATE'), (38-20, 'CARDINAL'), (Broncos, 'PRODUCT'), (Indy, 'PERSON')]
The Colts have now won five of seven in the series since Tony Dungy took over as coach and extended their league-best winning streak to nine when counting last year's playoff games.
[(Colts, 'PRODUCT'), (five of seven, 'DATE'), (Tony Dungy, 'PERSON'), (nine, 'CARDINAL'), (last year's, 'DATE')]
Despite overpowering the Colts with its usually efficient ground game in the first half, Denver (2-2) lost for the second straight week.
[(Colts, 'PRODUCT'), (the first half, 'DATE'), (Denver, 'GPE'), (the second straight week, 'DATE')]
For a while, it appeared the Broncos had a winning combination, but the Colts' one-two punch of Peyton Manning and Joseph Addai ruined everything.
[(Broncos, 'PRODUCT'), (Colts, 'PRODUCT'), (one-two, 'CARDINAL'), (Peyton Manning, 'FAC'), (Joseph Addai, 'PERSON')]
Manning methodically rallied the Colts from a 10-0 first-quarter deficit, and Joseph Addai helped Indy control the ball for much of the second half when Denver struggled to put drives together.
[(Colts, 'PRODUCT'), (10, 'CARDINAL'), (first-quarter, 'DATE'), (Joseph Addai, 'PERSON'), (Indy, 'PERSON'), (Denver, 'GPE')]

Eight-time Pro Bowl receiver Marvin Harrison left in the second quarter with a bruised left knee, and outsider linebacker Rob Morris was carted off the field with a sprained left knee late in the first half.

Even with a depleted crew, Manning still found a way to make things work.

Addai scored on a 14-yard TD run to make it 10-7, and Manning closed the half with a 9-yard scoring pass to Dallas Clark that gave Indy an improbable 14-13 halftime lead.

It didn't take Manning long to seize control in the second half, either.

"Sorry to disturb you," Ned the piemaker says politely to a hideously disfigured corpse he has just awakened with the touch of a finger, turning the cadaver into a kind of pop-up pastry right there on its metal morgue platter.
[]
It seems that Ned, for no apparent reason, has the ability to bring people back to life.
[(Ned, 'PERSON')]
Before clergymen start shouting "Sacrilege!," it should be noted that there are severe limitations on Ned's talent, as described to him by the unseen voice who bestowed it: "First touch, life; second touch, death, forever," he's told.

The revived can remain conscious for only a minute "without consequences -- any longer, someone else has to die," apparently whoever happens to be nearby.

A collaboration of brilliant craftsmen Bryan Fuller and Barry Sonnenfeld, the "Pushing Daisies" premiere is a colorful, cockeyed cocktail, either a lighthearted tragedy or a dungeon-dark comedy on the diciest theme of all, mortality -- mortality, great avatar of the unfair and the curse from which all other fears derive.
[(Bryan Fuller, 'PERSON'), (Barry Sonnenfeld, 'PERSON'), (Pushing Daisies, 'WORK_OF_ART')]

Toronto-Dominion Bank, Canada's third-biggest bank, agreed yesterday to buy Commerce Bancorp of New Jersey for $8.5 billion, taking advantage of a soaring currency for the biggest foreign takeover by a Canadian bank.
[(Toronto-Dominion Bank, 'ORG'), (Canada, 'GPE'), (third, 'ORDINAL'), (yesterday, 'DATE'), (New Jersey, 'GPE'), ($8.5 billion, 'MONEY'), (Canadian, 'NORP')]

But TD is making itself into a powerhouse in the northeastern United States.

The 62 percent surge in the Canadian dollar since 2002 has helped increase Toronto-Dominion's market value to more than $52 billion, making foreign acquisitions cheaper.

Britain to claim a million square km of Antarctica

[(Kate, 'PERSON'), (Wednesday, October 17, 2007, 'DATE'), (7:07 PM, 'TIME')]
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain plans to submit a claim to the United Nations to extend its Antarctic territory by a million square kilometers, the foreign office said on Wednesday.
[(LONDON, 'GPE'), (Reuters, 'ORG'), (Britain, 'GPE'), (the United Nations, 'ORG'), (Antarctic, 'LOC'), (a million square kilometers, 'QUANTITY'), (Wednesday, 'DATE')]
The claim is one of five territorial requests planned by the Britain ahead of a May 2009 deadline and covers a vast area of the seabed around British Antarctica near the south pole, a spokeswoman said.
[(one, 'CARDINAL'), (five, 'CARDINAL'), (Britain, 'GPE'), (May 2009, 'DATE'), (British Antarctica, 'LOC')]
"We are one of many coastal states who are submitting various claims," she told Reuters.
[(Reuters, 'ORG')]
She said the four other claims would be for Atlantic seabed territory around South Georgia and the Falkland Islands and also around Ascension Island in the South Atlantic, near the Bay of Biscay in the North Atlantic, and in the Hatton-Rockall basin off Scotland's coast.
[(four, 'CARDINAL'), (Atlantic, 'LOC'), (South Georgia, 'LOC'), (the Falkland Islands, 'GPE'), (Ascension Island, 'LOC'), (the South Atlantic, 'LOC'), (the Bay of Biscay, 'FAC'), (the North Atlantic, 'LOC'), (Scotland, 'GPE')]
The claim to extend British sovereignty in Antarctica could spark disputes with South American nations such as Argentina and Chile.
[(British, 'NORP'), (Antarctica, 'LOC'), (South American, 'NORP'), (Argentina, 'GPE'), (Chile, 'GPE')]
Argentine Foreign Minister Jorge Taiana said his country was working on its own presentation to the United Nations.
[(Argentine, 'NORP'), (Jorge Taiana, 'PERSON'), (the United Nations, 'ORG')]
This would cover the Antarctic as well as South Georgia and the Falkland Islands, called Malvinas by Argentina, which claims the islands and fought a 10-week war to try to wrest them from British control in 1982.
[(Antarctic, 'LOC'), (South Georgia, 'LOC'), (the Falkland Islands, 'GPE'), (Argentina, 'GPE'), (10-week, 'DATE'), (British, 'NORP'), (1982, 'DATE')]
"In defense of our national interest and our legitimate sovereign rights we are intensely working on our presentation," Taiana told reporters in Rome.
[(Taiana, 'GPE'), (Rome, 'GPE')]
The British claim also conflicts with the spirit of 1959 Antarctic Treaty, to which Britain is a signatory, which prevents all exploitation of oil gas and minerals, other than for scientific research.
[(British, 'NORP'), (1959, 'DATE'), (Antarctic Treaty, 'LAW'), (Britain, 'GPE')]
But the foreign office spokeswoman said that because of the Treaty, Britain's claim would be "theoretical" for the moment.

"It's incredibly unlikely that the Antarctic Treaty would ever be abolished," she said.

But in order to safeguard our interests for the future, we are submitting a claim.

Only a few claims have been made so far by the some 50 coastal states who could submit them.

The foreign office spokeswoman said Britain had lodged one joint claim with France, Spain and Ireland for extended territorial rights in the Bay of Biscay, and hoped to agree joint submissions for other regions too.
[(Britain, 'GPE'), (one, 'CARDINAL'), (France, 'GPE'), (Spain, 'GPE'), (Ireland, 'GPE'), (the Bay of Biscay, 'LOC')]
The claims are based on extending existing territorial rights beyond current 200 mile limits.
[(200 mile, 'QUANTITY')]
"We are in discussions with Iceland, Ireland and Denmark over the Hatton-Rockall area," she said.
[(Iceland, 'GPE'), (Ireland, 'GPE'), (Denmark, 'GPE'), (Hatton-Rockall, 'ORG')]
If different coastal states submit claims and there is a territorial dispute, the U.N. will simply park those claims and won't look them at all until any dispute has been resolved.
[(U.N., 'ORG')]
So it is of benefit to all states concerned to submit joint claims.

What Does a Rate Cut Mean to You?

"Good Morning America" financial contributor Mellody Hobson answers some frequently asked questions about what today's meeting of the Federal Reserve board means to consumers.
[(Good Morning America, 'WORK_OF_ART'), (Mellody Hobson, 'PERSON'), (today, 'DATE'), (the Federal Reserve, 'ORG')]
It seems as if the general consensus is the Fed will make a cut in interest rates at its meeting today, but by how much is up for debate.
[(Fed, 'ORG'), (today, 'DATE')]
What do you think will happen?
[]
While some are anticipating a cut of 0.5 percent, I'm leaning more conservatively and believe we will see a rate cut of 0.25 percent, which would bring the fed funds rate down to 5 percent from 5.25 percent.
[(0.5 percent, 'PERCENT'), (0.25 percent, 'PERCENT'), (5 percent, 'PERCENT'), (5.25 percent, 'PERCENT')]
Assuming there is a rate cut, it will represent the first cut since June 2006, or the first time the Fed has lowered rates in 17 consecutive quarters.
[(first, 'ORDINAL'), (June 2006, 'DATE'), (first, 'ORDINAL'), (Fed, 'ORG'), (17 consecutive quarters, 'DATE')]
What is the basis for the Fed potentially lowering the fed funds rate?
[(Fed, 'ORG'), (fed, 'ORG')]
The weakening job market propelled by steep declines in construction and manufacturing payrolls coupled with the housing market slump and the associated subprime mortgage crisis and credit crunch, suggests recessionary conditions might be lurking, which is spurring the Fed to take action to ensure continued economic growth.
[(Fed, 'ORG')]
Keep in mind, the fed funds rate is a key short-term interest rate that impacts consumer loans.
[(fed, 'ORG')]
Ultimately, by lowering the rate, the Fed would be making it less expensive for consumers to borrow money, which could, in turn, encourage continued spending, thereby stimulating the economy.
[(Fed, 'ORG')]
What about the stock market?
[]
Will the recent volatility influence the Fed?
[(Fed, 'ORG')]
Not directly.
[]
Remember, the purpose of the Fed is not to bail out investors in times of market turmoil.
[(Fed, 'ORG')]
Rather, the Fed's mandate is to set monetary policy.
[(Fed, 'ORG')]
Simply put, the goal of the Fed is to promote economic growth by keeping unemployment low and inflation stable.
[(Fed, 'ORG')]
And what does this mean for consumers?
[]
Will it help us get a handle on our mortgages and our credit card debt?
[]
The bottom line is, lower interest rates are a good thing for consumers.
[]
While the Fed does not directly control mortgage rates or interest rates on credit cards, it does have an indirect impact on these rates.
[(Fed, 'ORG')]
Credit card interest rates will dip slightly, as will auto loans and, even, mortgages.
[]
Homeowners with adjustable rate mortgages could see their rate reset at a lower amount, which is good news.
[]
However, the cut would not have a meaningful impact for consumers.
[]
The typical credit card holder could see their monthly payment drop only a couple of dollars, and homeowners could see mortgage rates dip slightly.
[(monthly, 'DATE'), (only a couple of dollars, 'CARDINAL')]
What is your outlook for the market?
[]
Also, do you think further cuts to the fed funds rate are on the horizon?
[(fed, 'ORG')]
Regardless of the outcome of [today's] meeting, I think we will continue to see choppy waters in the stock market.
[(today, 'DATE')]
Additional fallout from the subprime crisis is likely, and its full impact on the economy is unknown at this point.
[]
And, as I have said before, the market hates uncertainty, and these would definitely qualify as uncertain times.
[]
In terms of future rate cuts, the Fed meets again at the end of October, and then one last time before year-end, in mid-December.
[(Fed, 'ORG'), (the end of October, 'DATE'), (year-end, 'DATE'), (mid-December, 'DATE')]
Only the 12 members of the Federal Open Market Committee know for sure what will happen, but if I had to venture an educated guess, I would say that additional rate cuts are likely through the end of this year.

Was FDA Wrong to Cave to Vaccine Fears?
[(FDA Wrong to Cave to Vaccine Fears, 'ORG')]
As federal health officials offer more evidence that the mercury-containing vaccine preservative thimerosal is safe, many vaccine experts say in retrospect that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's decision to remove it from childhood vaccines may have done more harm than good by raising public fears.
[(the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's, 'ORG')]
And still others argue that research and funds still being spent on exploring the risks of thimerosal could be directed to more productive enterprises.
[]
A new study published in the New England Journal of Medicine concludes that early exposure to thimerosal does not cause any neurological problems.
[(the New England Journal of Medicine, 'ORG')]
Thimerosal, used in vaccines since the 1930s, has been a topic of controversy since the FDA banned it in 1999.
[(the 1930s, 'DATE'), (FDA, 'ORG'), (1999, 'DATE')]
Some claim that the additive causes autism and other brain development disorders in children.
[]
But the latest study joins a growing body of literature that shows thimerosal is safe and causes no long-term negative affects on children's health.
[]
Although no concrete evidence at the time showed that thimerosal was harmful, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) pushed for its elimination to quell the fears of parents who might otherwise not get their children vaccinated.

But in an editorial published alongside this new research, Dr. Paul Offit, chief of the division of infectious disease at the Children's Hospital in Philadelphia, argues that this move was likely unnecessary -- and it could have ended up causing even more alarm among parents.
[(Paul Offit, 'PERSON'), (the Children's Hospital, 'ORG'), (Philadelphia, 'GPE')]
"Critics wondered how removing something that hadn't been found to be unsafe could make vaccines even safer," Offit writes.
[]
Several vaccination experts agree.

"Thimerosal was removed from vaccines as a preventative measure, even though there was no indication that it represented a health risk," Mark Slifka of the Vaccine and Gene Therapy Institute and the Oregon Health & Sciences University says.
[(Mark Slifka, 'PERSON'), (Vaccine, 'PERSON'), (Gene Therapy Institute, 'ORG'), (the Oregon Health & Sciences University, 'ORG')]
However, it is easy for a skeptic to see this change in policy and jump to the conclusion that because thimerosal was removed, there must have been something wrong with it.
[]
The conspiracy theorists will continue to claim that thimerosal removal is 'proof' that a health danger exists and the negative impact of these individuals will be difficult to reconcile.
[]
"The removal of thimerosal created the impression of risk, where none existed," says Dr. Paul Krogstad, professor in the Departments of Pediatrics and Medical Pharmacology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA.
[(Paul Krogstad, 'PERSON'), (Departments of Pediatrics and Medical Pharmacology, 'ORG'), (the David Geffen School of Medicine, 'ORG'), (UCLA, 'ORG')]

Still, others say the widespread fear over thimerosal forced regulators into a corner.

"The decisions were made in a setting of less information than we now have, and thus the precautionary steps felt prudent and responsible at the time," says Dr. John Modlin, chair of the Department of Pediatrics at Dartmouth Medical School.

Most often, these repercussions have taken the form of legal battles.
[]
In his editorial, Offit describes how 4,800 parents of autistic children have taken their message to federal Vaccination Injury Compensation Program.

And some say there could be more legal battles to come.

"There will be more, and more complex, suits as we continue to develop more vaccines promising a life free of disease," Zanga says.

Consider, for example, the HPV vaccine.

[(these days, 'DATE'), (HPV, 'ORG'), (five to seven years, 'DATE')]
Misdirected Resources?
[]
Others note that continuing to fund research to prove the safety of thimerosal instead of using funds for more productive purposes, such as determining the real cause of autism and how to cure it, is counterproductive.
[]
"I am saddened that many families with autistic children continue to chase false causes when ... we should be placing our energies and resources into researching the real cause (s)," says Dr. Michael Muszynski, dean and professor of Clinical Sciences at the Florida State University College of Medicine.
[(Michael Muszynski, 'PERSON'), (Clinical Sciences, 'ORG'), (the Florida State University College of Medicine, 'ORG')]
In the most recent study funded by the CDC, researchers evaluated more than 1,000 kids aged 7 to 10 who were exposed to various levels of thimerosal as babies.
[(CDC, 'ORG'), (more than 1,000, 'CARDINAL'), (7 to 10, 'DATE')]
Researchers tested the children extensively, assessing the children in 42 different areas of neurological functioning and making almost 400 different statistical comparisons.
[(42, 'CARDINAL'), (almost 400, 'CARDINAL')]
They found that for the vast majority of tests, children with high levels of thimerosal exposure performed equally well compared to children with low exposure levels, indicating that thimerosal has no effect on brain development.

Wealthy Colleges Questioned About Costs
[]
Colleges and universities raked in money by the billions last year.
[(billions, 'CARDINAL'), (last year, 'DATE')]
But their investing success now has a price a movement in Congress to force the wealthiest schools to spend more of their money to keep down tuition.
[(Congress, 'ORG')]
In recent weeks, a string of colleges and universities have announced enviable investment results.
[(recent weeks, 'DATE')]
Leading the way was Yale, which earned 28 percent over the year ending June 30, increasing the school's endowment to $22.5 billion overall.
[(Yale, 'ORG'), (28 percent, 'PERCENT'), (the year ending June 30, 'DATE'), ($22.5 billion, 'MONEY')]
Harvard, the world's wealthiest university with $34.9 billion, beat the market again with a 23 percent return.
[(Harvard, 'ORG'), ($34.9 billion, 'MONEY'), (23 percent, 'PERCENT')]
There also were good returns for smaller schools such as Bowdoin (24.4 percent) and William & Mary (19.2 percent).
[(Bowdoin, 'GPE'), (24.4 percent, 'PERCENT'), (William & Mary, 'PERSON'), (19.2 percent, 'PERCENT')]
But while those numbers were coming out, some members of the Senate Finance Committee in Washington were wondering aloud why the rise in endowments isn't stemming tuition increases.
[(the Senate Finance Committee, 'ORG'), (Washington, 'GPE')]
At a hearing last month, lawmakers batted around the idea of forcing at least some of the wealthier colleges to spend more savings on reducing costs.
[(last month, 'DATE')]
Senators, what would your constituents say if gasoline cost $9.15 a gallon?
[(9.15, 'MONEY'), (gallon, 'CARDINAL')]
Lynne Munson, an adjunct fellow at the Center for College Affordability and Productivity in Washington told the committee.
[(Lynne Munson, 'PERSON'), (the Center for College Affordability and Productivity, 'ORG'), (Washington, 'GPE')]
Or if the price of milk was over $15?
[(15, 'MONEY')]
That is how much those items would cost if their price had gone up at the same rate that tuition has since 1980.
[(1980, 'DATE')]
In the mid-1990s, a billion-dollar endowment was a mark of the financial elite, a club with just 17 schools in its ranks.
[(the mid-1990s, 'DATE'), (billion-dollar, 'MONEY'), (just 17, 'CARDINAL')]
By last year, 62 colleges had hit the mark.
[(last year, 'DATE'), (62, 'CARDINAL')]
Within a few years there will likely be 100.
[(a few years, 'DATE'), (100, 'CARDINAL')]
Private foundations are required by law to spend at least 5 percent of their endowments each year on their missions, but public charities a category that includes colleges face no such requirement.
[(at least 5 percent, 'PERCENT'), (each year, 'DATE')]
Holding colleges to the same standard is an idea that clearly interests Iowa Republican Sen. Charles Grassley, the minority leader of the Senate Finance Committee and Capitol Hill's closest scrutinizer of non-profits.
[(Iowa, 'GPE'), (Republican, 'NORP'), (Charles Grassley, 'PERSON'), (the Senate Finance Committee, 'ORG'), (Capitol Hill's, 'ORG')]
"It'd be good to see the very elite institutions, with the richest endowments, take the lead and create a ripple effect throughout higher education to make college more affordable for everyone," he said in a statement.
[]
It's unclear right now, both Republicans and Democrats say, whether the proposal will make it out of the committee, which is considering several ideas related to taxes and higher education.
[(Republicans, 'NORP'), (Democrats, 'NORP')]
In fact, colleges spent on average 4.6 percent from their endowments last year, according to the latest figures from National Association of College and University Business Officers.
[(4.6 percent, 'PERCENT'), (last year, 'DATE'), (National Association of College and University Business Officers, 'ORG')]
But if the billionaire colleges alone spent the full 5 percent, that would mean an extra $1.5 billion available annually for financial aid, calculates Michael Dannenberg, director of education policy at the New America Foundation, a Washington think-tank.
[(the full 5 percent, 'PERCENT'), (an extra $1.5 billion, 'MONEY'), (annually, 'DATE'), (Michael Dannenberg, 'PERSON'), (the New America Foundation, 'ORG'), (Washington, 'GPE')]
He says such a requirement would be fair, given that colleges are allowed to invest tax-free.
[]
That perk has boosted many endowments by billions and carries an obligation to public service.
[(billions, 'CARDINAL')]
Higher education officials were angry they weren't allowed to speak out against the proposal at a hearing last month, but submitted their own testimony last week, arguing they spend plenty on public service and that endowments aren't simply savings accounts that can be tapped at any time for any reason.
[(last month, 'DATE'), (last week, 'DATE')]
Many endowment funds come with strings attached by donors on how they can be used.
[]
Colleges also have to budget prudently, taking market swings into account, and they try to avoid big jumps in spending just because the market did well in a particular year.
[(a particular year, 'DATE')]
But by sticking to gradual adjustments, they can look stingy.
[]
For instance, Yale is slated to get more than third of it's annual budget $843 million from its endowment this year.
[(Yale, 'ORG'), (more than third, 'CARDINAL'), ($843 million, 'MONEY'), (this year, 'DATE')]
But because its investments did so well, that's only about 3.7 percent of the endowment.
[(only about 3.7 percent, 'PERCENT')]
But the underlying issue is that the proposal would represent a major encroachment by Washington into university affairs.
[(Washington, 'GPE')]
Colleges oppose government involvement in anything from how they teach to the criteria they use in admissions.
[]
They would not take kindly to Congress directing them precisely how to spend their own money.
[(Congress, 'ORG')]
"We don't think as a general matter the federal government ought to be telling private philanthropic organizations, that have been around in some cases since before the federal government, how to spend their money," said Terry Hartle, senior vice president of the American Council on Education, the main group representing colleges and universities in Washington.
[(Terry Hartle, 'PERSON'), (the American Council on Education, 'ORG'), (Washington, 'GPE')]
Still, Hartle acknowledges colleges will have to take seriously the complaints about colleges costs with which constituents are deluging lawmakers.

"There isn't a college or university president in the country that doesn't recognize that federal policy makers in both houses of Congress in both parties are very concerned about rapidly rising prices in higher education," he said.

Hirsi Ali, an author and former member of the Dutch parliament, has lived under a death threat since 2004 that was delivered when filmmaker Theo van Gogh was murdered in the streets of Amsterdam.
[(Hirsi Ali, 'PERSON'), (Dutch, 'NORP'), (2004, 'DATE'), (Theo van Gogh, 'PERSON'), (Amsterdam, 'GPE')]
In a letter addressed to Hirsi Ali -- impaled in van Gogh's chest by his Islamist assassin Mohammed Bouyeri -- the Somali-born immigrant to the Netherlands was threatened with destruction in the name of Islam.
[(Hirsi Ali, 'PERSON'), (van Gogh's, 'PERSON'), (Islamist, 'NORP'), (Mohammed Bouyeri, 'PERSON'), (Somali, 'NORP'), (Netherlands, 'GPE'), (Islam, 'ORG')]
Hirsi Ali had worked with van Gogh, a descendent of the famous painter and a ubiquitous political figure in Dutch society.
[(Hirsi Ali, 'PERSON'), (van Gogh, 'PERSON'), (Dutch, 'NORP')]
The two produced a short film titled "Submission" in which Koranic verses were projected across the bodies of naked women in an attempt to protest what they saw as the Islamic abuse of women.
[(two, 'CARDINAL'), (Koranic, 'ORG'), (Islamic, 'NORP')]
Hirsi Ali first came to the Netherlands in a successful attempt to escape an arranged marriage in her homeland.
[(Hirsi Ali, 'PERSON'), (first, 'ORDINAL'), (Netherlands, 'GPE')]
Although originally a pious Muslim, she repudiated her faith and spoke out for freedom of expression and against Islamic practices that she deemed harmful to women.

Coming to America
[(America, 'GPE')]
The ire raised by her public commentary had already required her to seek protection before to van Gogh's assassination.
[(van Gogh's, 'PERSON')]
After the murder, Hirsi Ali went into hiding, and the Dutch government provided a round-the-clock security detail.
[(Hirsi Ali, 'PERSON'), (Dutch, 'NORP')]
Last year, she moved to the United States to take a post at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank.
[(Last year, 'DATE'), (the United States, 'GPE'), (the American Enterprise Institute, 'ORG')]
At the time, the Dutch government agreed to continue footing the bill for her protection, about $3 million a year.
[(Dutch, 'NORP'), (about $3 million, 'MONEY')]
But the conservative-led Dutch parliament this year decided to halt the payments at the beginning of October.
[(Dutch, 'NORP'), (this year, 'DATE'), (the beginning of October, 'DATE')]
Minister of Justice Hirsch Ballin justified the government's stance by saying the government would continue to pay for Hirsi Ali's protection so long as she resided within the Netherlands.
[(Hirsch Ballin, 'PERSON'), (Hirsi Ali's, 'ORG'), (Netherlands, 'GPE')]
To her supporters, the action was an act of bad faith.

In an open letter published in the French daily Libération, a group of French intellectuals today accused the Dutch government of "inexcusable cowardice."

"The Netherlands has closed its eyes to a world in which terrorism, intolerance and totalitarianism know no bounds," the group wrote in the letter.

Hirsi Ali has also criticized the government's decision.

In an interview last week with the Danish newspaper Jyllands Posten, famed for publishing cartoons of the Prophet that many Muslims found insulting, Hirsi Ali poured scorn on the Dutch action.

Earlier in the week, Danish Premier Anders Fogh Rasmussen criticized the Dutch government for ceasing the payments.
[(Earlier in the week, 'DATE'), (Danish, 'NORP'), (Dutch, 'NORP')]
He also offered Hirsi Ali a place to live under protection in Denmark.
[(Hirsi Ali, 'PERSON'), (Denmark, 'GPE')]
"Hirsi Ali must never be left in the lurch," Rasmussen told the Dutch daily De Volkskrant.
[(Hirsi Ali, 'WORK_OF_ART'), (Rasmussen, 'PERSON'), (Dutch, 'NORP'), (De Volkskrant, 'PERSON')]
Paying for Protection
[]
The American Enterprise Institute has set up a fund to help raise money for Hirsi Ali's protection.
[(The American Enterprise Institute, 'ORG'), (Hirsi Ali's, 'ORG')]
The organization said it was processing private donations to arrange for her security.
[]
Another fund would also be set up in the future to ensure the safety of other endangered Muslim dissidents, The Associated Press reported.
[(Muslim, 'NORP'), (The Associated Press, 'ORG')]
Despite the international furor, opinion within the Netherlands has largely backed the parliament's decision.
[(Netherlands, 'GPE'), (parliament, 'ORG')]
And, surprisingly, those arguing for the continued payment of Hirsi Ali's security costs have largely come from outside her supporter base.
[(Hirsi Ali's, 'ORG')]
The voices calling for continued funding within the Netherlands have mainly come from the left, according to Bibi van Ginkel, senior researcher at the Clingendael Institute, a Dutch international relations think tank.
[(Netherlands, 'GPE'), (Bibi van Ginkel, 'PERSON'), (the Clingendael Institute, 'ORG'), (Dutch, 'NORP')]
She's a high-profile person, whether or not you agree with her beliefs.
[]
The left has overlooked [her beliefs] and decided that she is an important person who contributes to an important debate, so they think that's something they do need to support, and as she is a Dutch citizen, they believe that for practical reasons the government should extend the financial support until an appropriate alternative is found," said van Ginkel.
[(Dutch, 'NORP'), (van Ginkel, 'PERSON')]
Still, regardless of the opposition coming from the left, the Ministry of Justice reported that an overwhelming majority of the Tweede Kamer (the lower house of the States-General of the Netherlands) had endorsed the Cabinet's resolution, according to De Volkskrant.
[(the Ministry of Justice, 'ORG'), (the Tweede Kamer, 'PRODUCT'), (Netherlands, 'GPE'), (Cabinet, 'ORG'), (De Volkskrant, 'PERSON')]
Arnold van Burg, a history and politics student at Leiden University, explained that the unwavering Dutch attitude partly results from a decline in Hirsi Ali's status within the Netherlands.

Cat Murder Trial Gets Laughs From Jury
[]
To Jim Stevenson, the cats under the San Luis Pass Bridge were more than a nuisance; they were a threat to the endangered birds he loved.

To John Newland, the toll taker on the bridge, the cats were family; he gave them names and spent his own money hundreds of dollars each month to feed them.

Stevenson is a prominent birder who owns a bed and breakfast in Galveston, Texas, that caters to birders.

He is charged with cruelty to animals for shooting a cat he believed was preying on the endangered birds he worked so hard to protect.

Saudi Arabia to Attend Peace Conference In The US

Saudi Arabia and other Arab nations decided Friday to attend next week's U.S.-sponsored Middle East peace conference.

But it was not entirely clear from his comments whether Syria could still decide not to attend or may send a lower-level representative.

"We are waiting for final arrangements and it will take place in the additional talks," al-Faisal said.

Those talks will take place in a meeting of Arab foreign ministers in Washington on Monday, a day before the Annapolis conference.
[(Arab, 'NORP'), (Washington, 'GPE'), (Monday, 'DATE'), (a day, 'DATE'), (Annapolis, 'ORG')]

[(Saudi Arabia, 'GPE'), (Israel, 'GPE'), (Israel, 'GPE'), (Jewish, 'NORP')]

Professor Fucius Yunlan, who runs counseling groups in Beijing, sees the increase in divorce as a positive step.

One-Child Policy Has Consequences
[(One-Child Policy Has Consequences, 'CARDINAL')]
As China becomes more socially liberal, with the influx of Western ideas and norms, critics warn that young people feel free to rush in and out of marriage.
[(China, 'GPE')]
Fucius offers another explanation: China's one-child policy.
[(Fucius, 'ORG'), (China, 'GPE'), (one, 'CARDINAL')]
She said the Chinese government's policy of curbing population growth by urging families to have only one child has had some unintended consequences.
[(Chinese, 'NORP'), (only one, 'CARDINAL')]
This is the first generation of Chinese to grow up in one-child families, and they are often so spoiled that they are unable to make the sacrifices and compromises required of marriage.
[(first, 'ORDINAL'), (Chinese, 'NORP'), (one, 'CARDINAL')]
Fucius said only children are less trained in sharing and equal understanding, but there is an upside.

Too Little, Too Late On Iran?, National Review Online: Putting Revolutionary Guard On Terror List Is Welcome, But Not Enough
[(Iran, 'GPE'), (National Review Online, 'ORG'), (Revolutionary Guard, 'ORG')]
There is no getting around the fact that the Revolutionary Guard  including the Quds Force  expresses the will of Irans highest rulers.
[(Revolutionary Guard, 'ORG'), (Quds Force, 'ORG')]
If what it does counts as terrorism, they count as terrorists.
[]
(National Review Online) This column was written by the editors of National Review Online.
[(National Review Online, 'ORG'), (National Review Online, 'ORG')]
Two reactions are appropriate to the Bush administrations decision to place Irans Revolutionary Guard on the State Departments list of terrorist organizations.
[(Two, 'CARDINAL'), (Bush, 'PERSON'), (Revolutionary Guard, 'ORG'), (State, 'ORG')]
First, one should cheer.
[(First, 'ORDINAL')]
Second, one should ask how much longer it will take the president to resolve the contradiction at the heart of his Iran policy.
[(Second, 'ORDINAL'), (Iran, 'GPE')]
One should cheer because the Revolutionary Guard is among the worlds most effective forces for barbarity and chaos.
[(the Revolutionary Guard, 'ORG')]
Separate from Irans regular military, it espouses the revolution-exporting ideology of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Ali Khamenei (the latter of whom possesses ultimate control of its actions).
[(Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, 'PERSON'), (Ali Khamenei, 'PERSON')]
It has killed Americans gladly, as at the Khobar Towers.
[(Americans, 'NORP'), (the Khobar Towers, 'FAC')]
Its current specialty is killing American soldiers in Iraq, through Iraqi proxies, with armor-piercing bombs.
[(American, 'NORP'), (Iraq, 'GPE'), (Iraqi, 'NORP')]
These things alone do not make it a terrorist group in the precise sense of that term, but its arming and financing of Hezbollah certainly does.
[(Hezbollah, 'ORG')]
Likewise the massacres of civilians that its aid to Iraqi militants has made possible.
[(Iraqi, 'NORP')]
To designate the Revolutionary Guard as a terrorist entity, then, is to acknowledge reality.
[(the Revolutionary Guard, 'ORG')]
Yet there is something decidedly unrealistic in the idea that the Revolutionary Guard can be separated from the Iranian government as a whole.
[(the Revolutionary Guard, 'ORG'), (Iranian, 'NORP')]
The distinctions got even more jesuitical when it emerged that the State Department might not designate the entire Revolutionary Guard a terrorist organization, but simply its Quds Force, composed of special covert units.
[(the State Department, 'ORG'), (Revolutionary Guard, 'ORG'), (Quds Force, 'ORG')]
Given their history of working mayhem in the Middle East and beyond (recall, for example, their handiwork in Argentina in 1994), this is an obvious enough fact, and the State Department designation will do little to make it more obvious.
[(the Middle East, 'LOC'), (Argentina, 'GPE'), (1994, 'DATE'), (the State Department, 'ORG')]
It will also do little to hurt Iran  the designation would freeze any assets the Revolutionary Guard had in the U.S., but, as you might imagine, it prefers to bank elsewhere.
[(Iran, 'GPE'), (the Revolutionary Guard, 'ORG'), (U.S., 'GPE')]
What the designation does do is lay bare the contradiction in President Bushs Iran policy.
[(Iran, 'GPE')]
After September 11, in a moment of great strategic clarity, Bush said that the U.S. would not distinguish between terrorists and the governments that harbored them.
[(September 11, 'DATE'), (Bush, 'PERSON'), (U.S., 'GPE')]
Yet his administration has approached Iran  the worlds foremost state sponsor of terrorism  as though it were a legitimate government, capable of being persuaded to adopt positions agreeable to liberal democracies.
[(Iran, 'GPE')]
On Irans nuclear program, Bush has deferred first to Europe and then to Condoleezza Rices State Department in allowing years of negotiating, followed by a few more years of negotiating, followed by (wait for it) more negotiating.
[(Bush, 'PERSON'), (first, 'ORDINAL'), (Europe, 'LOC'), (Condoleezza Rices State Department, 'PERSON'), (years, 'DATE'), (a few more years, 'DATE')]
Worse than do nothing, this strategy created an illusion that the world was seriously confronting Iran when just the opposite was true.
[(Iran, 'GPE')]
The two Security Council resolutions against the Islamic Republic were so weak as to be meaningless, except in distracting attention from alternative courses of action (e.g., effective sanctions or military force).
[(two, 'CARDINAL'), (Security Council, 'ORG'), (the Islamic Republic, 'GPE')]
Irans leaders have grown more brazen at every turn  kidnappings of foreign soldiers and proxy wars are now par for the course  yet the Bush administration has remained unable to forge a credible policy.
[(Bush, 'PERSON')]
What one should hope now is that the administration, in its waning days, is making a course correction.
[(its waning days, 'DATE')]
The squeamishness with which much of Europe opposes the designation suggests that it fears just this.
[(Europe, 'LOC')]
For a variety of reasons  economic interest, anti-Americanism, and reflexive pacifism chief among them  it would prefer to avoid any bad blood with the Islamic Republic.
[(anti-Americanism, 'NORP'), (the Islamic Republic, 'GPE')]
Most of the U.S. State Department feels likewise.
[(the U.S. State Department, 'ORG')]
But the simple truth is that, unless Irans regime gives up both its terrorist ideology and its weapons, we will never be safe.
[]
The president has taken an important  albeit partial and overdue  step toward facing that unpleasant reality.

Women May Need Different Heart Treatments, Doctors Say Surgeries Which Typically Save Men's Lives Can Be Deadly For Women
[]
VIENNA, Austria, Sept.
[(VIENNA, 'GPE'), (Austria, 'GPE'), (Sept., 'DATE')]
We have had hints in the past that women don't respond to treatment in exactly the same way as men.

Dr. Christopher Cannon
[(Christopher Cannon, 'PERSON')]
(AP) Women with heart problems may need to be treated differently than men, doctors said Monday.
[(AP, 'ORG'), (Monday, 'DATE')]
Research presented at the annual European Society of Cardiology meeting in Vienna suggested that surgeries which typically save men's lives can be deadly for women.
[(annual, 'DATE'), (European, 'NORP'), (Vienna, 'GPE')]
A small study of 184 women conducted by Dr. Eva Swahn of the department of cardiology at University Hospital in Linkoping, Sweden, found that women who had major heart operations like a coronary bypass were more likely than men to die.
[(184, 'CARDINAL'), (Eva Swahn, 'PERSON'), (the department of cardiology, 'ORG'), (University Hospital, 'ORG'), (Linkoping, 'GPE'), (Sweden, 'GPE')]
The study was part of a larger study funded by pharmaceutical companies Sanofi-Aventis and GlaxoSmithKline Plc.
[(GlaxoSmithKline Plc, 'ORG')]
Swahn consults occasionally for various pharmaceuticals and is writing a book for AstraZeneca.
[(Swahn, 'PERSON'), (AstraZeneca, 'PRODUCT')]
Although experts said no definitive conclusions can be drawn from Swahn's study, they agreed the idea that women might need different treatment than men should be studied further.
[(Swahn, 'PERSON')]
"We have had hints in the past that women don't respond to treatment in exactly the same way as men," said Dr. Christopher Cannon, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard University and spokesman for the American College of Cardiology.
[(Christopher Cannon, 'PERSON'), (Harvard University, 'ORG'), (the American College of Cardiology, 'ORG')]
Cannon was not connected to Swahn's research.
[(Swahn, 'PERSON')]
Last month, the American College of Cardiology revised its treatment guidelines to recommend that doctors should think twice before subjecting women at low risk of heart disease to invasive procedures.
[(Last month, 'DATE'), (the American College of Cardiology, 'ORG')]
For example, when doctors see women who could have a clogged coronary artery, instead of performing an immediate angioplasty - a procedure in which a tiny balloon inflates the clogged vessel - they should wait and see if further symptoms develop first.
[(first, 'ORDINAL')]
In Europe, the guidelines for treating heart disease are not generally different for men and women.
[(Europe, 'LOC')]
Women typically have a better chance of surviving a heart attack than men.
[]
But in Swahn's study, as in two previous Scandinavian trials that looked at hundreds of women, experts found that women had a higher death rate than men when invasive heart procedures were performed.
[(Swahn, 'PERSON'), (two, 'CARDINAL'), (Scandinavian, 'NORP'), (hundreds, 'CARDINAL')]
In Swahn's study, the women were divided into two equal groups: one which had an invasive procedure like a coronary bypass surgery or an angioplasty and another that waited until further symptoms developed.
[(Swahn, 'PERSON'), (two, 'CARDINAL'), (one, 'CARDINAL')]
Of the women who had an invasive procedure, eight died after one year.
[(eight, 'CARDINAL'), (one year, 'DATE')]
That compares to just one death in the other group.
[(one, 'CARDINAL')]
"There is a big question mark over why this is happening," Swahn said.
[(Swahn, 'PERSON')]
We want there to be equality between the genders, but that doesn't mean that women and men should get the same treatment.
[]
Doctors are not sure what accounts for the discrepancy.
[]
But women tend to have smaller hearts and vessels, which could complicate any surgical procedure.
[]
For example, when catheters need to be inserted into the artery to take photos of what is happening inside the body, having smaller arteries does not help.
[]
"Catheters only come in certain sizes," Cannon side.
[]
If the doctor misses, there could be some bleeding.
[]
Women also tend to have more side effects from medicines.
[]
Hormonal factors could also play a role, though doctors are not exactly sure how female-specific hormones affect the cardiovascular system.
[]
Compounding the problem is the fact that women are usually about a decade older than men by the time they develop heart problems, so other health problems associated with old age could also worsen their chances of surviving heart surgery.

Thompson Hits Rivals On Immigration, Cites 1996 Vote Against "Sanctuary Cities" As Proof He Is The True Conservative
[(Thompson Hits Rivals On Immigration, 'ORG')]
(AP) Fred Thompson accused Republican campaign rivals Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney of being soft on illegal immigration Thursday, dismissing them as latecomers to the issue as they strive for the presidency. I was walking the walk when others weren't even talking the talk yet, Thompson said at an appearance with supporters in Georgia.

He said he voted in 1996 to outlaw sanctuary cities, where city employees are not required to report illegal immigrants to federal authorities. Along about that same time, Mayor Giuliani was supporting the concept of sanctuary cities, Thompson said. Governor Romney certainly didn't say anything against sanctuary cities until recently. Romney, who was campaigning in South Carolina, answered back, arguing that as Massachusetts governor he authorized state police to enforce federal immigration law and threatened to veto a measure allowing undocumented immigrant students to pay the same in-state tuition at state colleges as residents. I've been running for president a lot longer than he has, Romney said derisively of Thompson. I've been talking about sanctuary cities and illegal immigration from the very beginning.

Flames Change Dynamic On U.S. Border, Fewer Places To Hide, But Smugglers Think That With Guards Busy, Perhaps Less Need To Hide

(AP) One of Southern California's largest wildfires has frightened many illegal immigrants from hiking through a popular corridor to cross from Mexico even as the Border Patrol has withdrawn some agents.
[(AP, 'ORG'), (One, 'CARDINAL'), (Southern California's, 'LOC'), (Mexico, 'GPE')]

"They're holding back," Mark Mahler, a Border Patrol agent, said as he kept watch over an evacuated highway checkpoint that was closed Monday on State Route 94.

The checkpoint on the two-lane highway, which narrowly escaped damage, is normally a major obstacle for illegal crossers.

The fire left miles of black ash in the canyons around Dulzura, an evacuated hamlet about 25 miles east of San Diego, where dozens of homes were destroyed.
[(Dulzura, 'GPE'), (about 25 miles, 'QUANTITY'), (San Diego, 'GPE'), (dozens, 'CARDINAL')]
Thousands of foot trails once covered by dense shrub were laid bare.

Road closures due to the fire meant migrants could not meet drivers, Mahler said.

Typically, migrants pay about $1,500 each to be guided through rugged canyons for hours, even days, and be picked up by someone at a roadside checkpoint for the drive to San Diego.
[(about $1,500, 'MONEY'), (hours, 'TIME'), (San Diego, 'GPE')]
Many illegal immigrants appeared to heed the advice of the Border Patrol and the Mexican government, aired on television and radio in Tijuana, Mexico, to stay away from the fires.

AIDS drug shows potential as cancer weapon

Protease inhibitors slow cancer cell growth in mice

[(10:35 a.m., 'TIME')]
A drug used to treat people infected with the AIDS virus has shown promise as a possible future weapon against cancer, U.S. researchers said on Friday.
[(U.S., 'GPE'), (Friday, 'DATE')]
Scientists at the U.S. National Cancer Institute examined how drugs called protease inhibitors, usually given in combination with other drugs to fight the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, performed against several types of cancer including non-small cell lung cancer.
[(the U.S. National Cancer Institute, 'ORG')]
In a study published in the journal Clinical Cancer Research, the scientists tested whether protease inhibitors would slow cancer cell growth in the laboratory and in mice.
[(Clinical Cancer Research, 'ORG')]
Three of six drugs they tried inhibited cancer cell growth.
[(Three, 'CARDINAL'), (six, 'CARDINAL')]
The most effective of the drugs was nelfinavir, sold by Roche Holding AG as Viracept, the researchers said.
[(Roche Holding AG, 'ORG'), (Viracept, 'ORG')]
The drug also slowed the growth of both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant breast cancer cells, they added.

The researchers have started an initial clinical trial to test nelfinavir in cancer patients.

Viracept won marketing approval in Europe in 1998.

It was cleared for use a year earlier in the United States, where it is sold by Pfizer Inc.
[(a year earlier, 'DATE'), (the United States, 'GPE'), (Pfizer Inc., 'ORG')]

"Quarterlife" begins Nov. 11, paired with social networking site

LOS ANGELES - The creative team behind such TV shows as "Thirtysomething" and "My So-Called Life" are launching a Web-based show, hoping to find the creative freedom online that they say is lacking on broadcast networks.

DETROIT - In the document that spells out the tentative pact between General Motors Corp. and the United Auto Workers, their futures are listed as: "demand and business case dependent," "no future product allocation," or even possible sale or closure.
[(DETROIT, 'GPE'), (General Motors Corp., 'ORG'), (the United Auto Workers, 'ORG')]
Fifteen factories in places such as Wentzville, Missouri; Wilmington, Delaware; and Flint, Michigan, have been left on shaky ground by the pact that the UAW hailed as having won unprecedented job security from GM.

Most of the 15 factories, which together employ more than 40,000 hourly workers, will see their current work go out of production in 2011, when the four-year contract would expire, with the next generation of their main products listed as dependent on demand and business cases, according to a UAW document called the "white book" that spells out contract details.
[(15, 'CARDINAL'), (more than 40,000, 'CARDINAL'), (hourly, 'TIME'), (2011, 'DATE'), (four-year, 'DATE'), (UAW, 'ORG')]

UAW officials, in a summary of the contract, touted job security pledges won in the negotiations including commitments for new products at 16 assembly plants.

The jury ultimately found her guilty of a lesser offense, voluntary manslaughter.
[]
The conviction still involved the intentional killing of a human being, but here the offender had no prior intent to kill.
[]
Instead the offender is said to act during "the heat of passion," under circumstances that would cause a reasonable person to become emotionally or mentally disturbed, thus absolving them of full responsibility for the crime.
[]
The penalty for voluntary manslaughter is much less than for murder - a sentence of only 3-6 years in prison as opposed to a possibility of life for murder.
[]
Just take a moment to recognize how monumental a difference this defense can make!
[]
If used improperly we might be putting cold-blooded killers back on the street.
[]
We might even be giving them back their children without any reassurance that they won't act violently again!
[]
In fact, Mary Winkler's only real, lasting punishment has been separation from her daughters.
[(Mary Winkler's, 'PERSON')]
Since her arrest she has only seen her daughters twice.
[]
Her late husband's parents have temporary custody of the girls and are working hard to adopt them and terminate Mary's parental rights.
[]
But a judge ruled on September 19, 2007 that Mary Winkler can begin supervised visits with her daughters on September 29.
[(September 19, 2007, 'DATE'), (Mary Winkler, 'PERSON'), (September 29, 'DATE')]
In order to succeed in using this defense, the victim must generally prove that there was real abuse and that she acted out violently because she believed that it was necessary for self-defense or because she believed she was in imminent harm.
[]
How much abuse is enough to rise to the level to implicate this defense?
[]
How much evidence is needed?
[]
Further, does lack of evidence always mean that it doesn't exist?
[]
The problem is that abuse victims often wish to keep abuse private and avoid the public, especially after a particularly rough episode.
[]
Thus it's hard to determine when lack of evidence of an abusive relationship means a woman is improperly trying to use the defense or if it just means she was hiding abuse that she was ashamed of.
[]
So was Mary Winkler really abused to the point that she should have been absolved from essentially all responsibility for murdering her husband?
[(Mary Winkler, 'PERSON')]
While it's clear that there was more abuse than the Winklers led on, was it really enough to meet the standard for a BWS defense?
[(Winklers, 'ORG'), (BWS, 'ORG')]
While family and friends testified to having seen occasional black eyes and bruises, according to an interview on Oprah, Mary Winkler revealed that behind closed doors, her husband's terrible temper terrorized their family.
[(Oprah, 'PERSON'), (Mary Winkler, 'PERSON')]
Mary Winkler said her husband threatened her with a gun (ironically the same one which took his life.)
[(Mary Winkler, 'PERSON')]
She said he said he'd kill her and chop her into a million pieces himself.
[(a million, 'CARDINAL')]
A teary eyed Mary also revealed that he sexually abused her and forced her to perform sex acts against her will.
[]
She also mentioned a particularly disturbing incident where he temporarily suffocated his daughter to stop her from crying by covering her mouth and pinching her nose.
[]
However, while it seems clear that she was a victim of abuse, what isn't as crystal clear is that she was in imminent harm's way.
[]
After all, he was sleeping and didn't seemingly pose any such threat in that state.
[]
Whether justice was served by such a short sentence in Winkler's case is a moot point since she is already free.
[]
But concerns swirl in my mind as to whether this is setting bad precedent.
[]
Does the Winkler defense send the message that you can kill your husband if he's abused you in the past?
[]
Further, if you can use this legal defense of BWS to exonerate yourself from consequences even in absence of imminent danger might this defense be encouraging these abused women to kill, rather than get out of an abusive relationship?
[(BWS, 'ORG')]
While I certainly believe the defense has its place, I am equally concerned with potential for its abuse.
[]
We need a sane and rational basis for what is essentially a temporary insanity defense ... and not a license to kill.

Richard H. Lenny, who has struggled to preserve The Hershey Co.'s (HSY) prominence as the nation's largest candy maker, said Monday that he will retire as chairman, president and chief executive at the end of this year.
[(Richard H. Lenny, 'PERSON'), (The Hershey Co.'s, 'ORG'), (HSY, 'ORG'), (Monday, 'DATE'), (the end of this year, 'DATE')]
"The long-term prospects for our category and particularly for our company remain promising," Lenny said in a statement issued by the company.
[(Lenny, 'PERSON')]
I look forward to working closely with my successor so that the transition to new leadership will be effective and seamless.
[]
Lenny, 55, has been Hershey's top executive since 2001.
[(Lenny, 'PERSON'), (55, 'DATE'), (Hershey, 'ORG'), (2001, 'DATE')]
The board thanked Lenny for developing a "value-enhancing strategy with the over-arching goal of building stockholder value over the long-term" and praised him for assembling an "excellent" leadership team.
[(Lenny, 'PERSON')]
The board has begun the succession process and looks forward to making an announcement in the near future.

Once announced, there will be an orderly transition from Rick to his successor," said Robert H. Campbell, chairman of the board's compensation and executive organization committee.
[(Rick, 'PERSON'), (Robert H. Campbell, 'PERSON')]
Almost from the start, Lenny's tenure has been bumpy.

In 2002, he weathered a strike by 2,700 union workers that largely idled two of Hershey's major plants for 42 days.
[(2002, 'DATE'), (2,700, 'CARDINAL'), (two, 'CARDINAL'), (Hershey, 'ORG'), (42 days, 'DATE')]

Lenny has pushed to catch up with Hershey's competitors in lucrative overseas candy markets such as China and India.
[(Lenny, 'PERSON'), (Hershey, 'ORG'), (China, 'GPE'), (India, 'GPE')]
Earlier this year, Hershey announced it will close six U.S. and Canadian plants and cut more than 3,000 workers in the two countries, including 900 total at its hometown plants, and shift more of its production to contractors and a new plant it is building in Mexico.

Hershey's second-quarter profit fell 96 percent as the company spent heavily to transform production lines and revive flat sales, and it also slashed its earning estimate for the rest of 2007 as its stock price plummeted.
[(Hershey, 'GPE'), (second-quarter, 'DATE'), (96 percent, 'PERCENT')]
At a tense shareholders meeting in April, some in the audience vented anger over job cuts that they said were contrary to the philosophy of company founder Milton S. Hershey, while others applauded when Lenny said his chief responsibility is to keep the company competitive.
[(April, 'DATE'), (Milton S. Hershey, 'PERSON'), (Lenny, 'PERSON')]
"None of you knows how difficult it is," Lenny told shareholders who criticized the layoffs.

Asked why Lenny decided to retire now, Hershey spokesman Kirk D. Saville declined to elaborate beyond a one-line statement.

[(Jan Eliasson, 'PERSON'), (U.N., 'ORG'), (Darfur, 'GPE'), (U.N./AU (African Union, 'ORG'), (first, 'ORDINAL'), (Oct. 27, 'DATE'), (Libya, 'GPE')]
While he acknowledges the importance of including civil society, Arab tribes, women, and displaced Darfurians in the talks, he says he "cannot promise full participation at the negotiation table for all groups."
[(Arab, 'NORP'), (Darfurians, 'NORP')]
He calls the frustration and anger in the Darfur camps a "ticking bomb," and stresses that "without a peace to keep, peacekeeping becomes futile."
[(Darfur, 'GPE')]
You've been working for 10 months now to get Darfur's rebel groups to some kind of unified position.
[(10 months, 'DATE'), (Darfur, 'PERSON')]

What is the nature of the divisions?: The parties, SLM [Sudanese Liberation Movement] and JEM [Justice and Equality Movement], have different ideological colors, no doubt.

SLM is very strongly a Darfurian party; the Justice and Equality Movement also has a national program.
[(SLM, 'ORG'), (Darfurian, 'NORP'), (the Justice and Equality Movement, 'ORG')]
There are other ideological differences that I cannot indeed describe, but there is also, in Darfur, an element of difference of the tribes.
[(Darfur, 'GPE')]
Darfur is a country of strong and proud traditions, where the tribes play a very important role.
[(Darfur, 'GPE')]
You have the Fur tribes; in fact, Darfur means land of the Furs.
[(Fur, 'ORG'), (Darfur, 'GPE'), (Furs, 'ORG')]
Dar means land and Fur is the major tribe.

You have the Zaghawa - and this shows the relationship of the neighboring states, if you take into account that the president of Chad is a Zaghawa.
[(Chad, 'GPE'), (Zaghawa, 'GPE')]
You have the Massalit, which is another important tribe, and you have the Rizeigat - a tribe of Arabs that is very important.
[(Massalit, 'PERSON'), (Arabs, 'NORP')]
These tribes form the traditional structure of Darfur, and sadly this structure, this sociocultural fabric, has been torn apart.
[(Darfur, 'GPE')]
They still play a role, but so many of the movements have tribal elements, and that has been a divisive factor between both SLM and JEM.
[(SLM, 'ORG'), (JEM, 'ORG')]
At this point it is not clear whether these rebel groups actually represent the interests of the people of Darfur.

You've talked about the importance of including groups like women, IDPs [Internally Displaced Persons], and Arab tribal groups in the peace process.

How will the positions of these stakeholders be represented at the talks?
[]
It is very important for the credibility of the process that we include civil society, traditional leaders, women's groups, and other representatives of internally displaced people and refugees.
[]
In a country or region that has been struck by this terrible disaster, the methods of selection are not well developed, so it's hard to identify who are the best representatives of these groups.

We have a dialogue with these different categories through the Darfur-Darfur Dialogue by Mr. Abdul Mohammad, and our own civil-affairs component of the United Nations.

[(Salim [Salim Salim, 'PERSON'), (AU, 'GPE')]

[(Tripoli, 'GPE'), (the 27th of October, 'DATE')]
The key areas are wealth sharing, power sharing, and security.
[]
There is also interest in discussing humanitarian affairs and land issues.
[]
We have a plan to invite these representatives for specific sessions to make sure their voices are heard when substantial decisions start [being made on] an area that affects them.
[]
The three major issues for the people of Darfur, particularly those in the camps, are security: disarmament of the militias; compensation or "blood money," which is from the huge loss of lives and property; and the right to return to their land.

Evangelicals Hesitant About Thompson
[]
Prominent evangelical leaders who spent the summer hoping Fred Thompson would emerge as their favored Republican presidential contender are having doubts as he begins his long-teased campaign.
[(Fred Thompson, 'PERSON'), (Republican, 'NORP')]
For social conservatives dissatisfied with other GOP choices, the "Law & Order" actor and former Tennessee senator represents a Ronald Reagan-like figure, someone they hope will agree with them on issues and stands a chance of winning.
[(GOP, 'ORG'), (the "Law & Order, 'ORG'), (Tennessee, 'GPE'), (Ronald Reagan, 'PERSON')]
But Thompson's less-than-clear stance on a federal gay marriage amendment and his delay in entering the race are partly responsible for a sudden shyness among leading evangelicals.

"A month or two ago, I sensed there was some urgency for people to make a move and find a candidate," said Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, a Washington-based conservative Christian group.

A loose network of influential evangelical leaders known as the Arlington Group met privately Wednesday and Thursday in Washington to discuss presidential politics and other issues, participants said.
[(the Arlington Group, 'ORG'), (Wednesday, 'DATE'), (Thursday, 'DATE'), (Washington, 'GPE')]
Although the group does not endorse candidates, individual members have done so in the past, and one of the organization's founding principles is to get the movement's leaders on the same page when possible.
[]
Some in the meeting shared their presidential leanings, but the consensus was that more time is needed to gauge Thompson's performance, according to a participant.

A clearer picture may develop Oct. 19-21 during a "Values Voter Summit" in Washington that will include a presidential straw poll.
[(Oct. 19-21, 'DATE'), (Values Voter Summit, 'WORK_OF_ART'), (Washington, 'GPE')]
In June, Thompson met privately with several Arlington Group members, many of whom are uncomfortable with the GOP top tier for various reasons: Arizona Sen. John McCain for championing campaign-finance overhaul and labeling some evangelical figures "agents of intolerance"; former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani for backing abortion rights and gay rights; and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney for his social-issue policy reversals and - for some members - his Mormon faith.

Earlier this summer, doubts crept in following reports on Thompson's role in crafting campaign finance reform and stories that he lobbied for an abortion rights group.
[(Earlier this summer, 'DATE'), (Thompson, 'ORG')]
More recently, Thompson has come under scrutiny for his position on a constitutional amendment on gay marriage, a defining issue for the Christian right.
[(Thompson, 'ORG'), (Christian, 'NORP')]
Thompson told CNN in August that he supports an amendment that would prohibit states from imposing their gay marriage laws on other states.
[(Thompson, 'ORG'), (CNN, 'ORG'), (August, 'DATE')]

[(Thompson, 'ORG'), (June, 'DATE')]
Now, they wonder if he is flip- flopping.

One person in attendance - Mathew Staver of the Liberty Counsel, a Florida-based conservative legal group - said Thompson described going back and forth about the merits of an amendment prohibiting gay marriage nationwide.

Then he said in June he was for it.

So if now he's saying he's against it, to me that's a double-minded person.
[]
And that would be a real concern for religious conservatives.
[]
Messages left with Thompson campaign were not returned.
[(Thompson, 'PERSON')]
Several Christian right leaders said opposition to a broad amendment would hurt Thompson with evangelicals, but not necessarily cause irreparable harm.
[(Christian, 'NORP'), (Thompson, 'ORG')]
Others played down the issue, pointing out that their favored approach was politically impossible anyway because Democrats control the House and Senate.
[(Democrats, 'NORP'), (House, 'ORG'), (Senate, 'ORG')]
Richard Land, president of the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission, said Thompson's position is consistent with the former senator's support for limited federal government and giving power to the states.
[(Richard Land, 'PERSON'), (the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission, 'ORG'), (Thompson, 'ORG')]
Land said it is healthy that expectations for Thompson have diminished from unrealistic levels and he does not think evangelical excitement has dimmed for a man he described as a "masterful retail politician."
[(Thompson, 'ORG')]
Many evangelical leaders said one of Thompson's biggest draws is his perceived electability.

Governments Demand a Bigger Share of Oil

TORONTO (AP) - The oil industry is under assault globally by nations and even provinces who want companies like Exxon Mobil, Chevron and Suncor to cough up more royalties they can use to address issues like poverty and education.

It's a move the industry warns could devastate Alberta's oil patch.

[(Alberta, 'GPE'), (Venezuela, 'GPE'), (last month, 'DATE'), (20 percent, 'PERCENT'), (roughly $2 billion, 'MONEY')]
Under President Hugo Chavez, Venezuela raised royalty and tax rates on foreign oil companies, then later took majority control of all oil projects as part of a larger nationalization drive of "strategic" economic sectors.

China says Gates visit could soothe US ties

Bush defends attorney general pick in torture dispute
[(Bush, 'PERSON')]
President George W. Bush said Thursday that his attorney general nominee will not tell lawmakers weighing his confirmation if he judges "waterboarding" of terrorism suspects is torture, thus illegal.
[(George W. Bush, 'PERSON'), (Thursday, 'DATE')]
Bush's defiant defense of Michael Mukasey came in a speech that portrayed his Democratic critics as weak on terrorism -- a replay of his successful 2004 reelection message as the 2008 White House race heats up.
[(Bush, 'PERSON'), (Michael Mukasey, 'PERSON'), (Democratic, 'NORP'), (2004, 'DATE'), (2008, 'DATE'), (White House, 'ORG')]
Prominent Democrats, whose party retook the US Congress in November 2006 largely thanks to anger at the unpopular war in Iraq, quickly shot back that they would oppose Mukasey if he did not answer the question.
[(Democrats, 'NORP'), (US, 'GPE'), (Congress, 'ORG'), (November 2006, 'DATE'), (Iraq, 'GPE'), (Mukasey, 'PERSON')]
The nomination, once thought to virtually be a sure thing, appeared to have run aground as some Republicans and Democrats demanded to know whether Mukasey considers waterboarding -- which experts liken to controlled drowning -- to violate US legal prohibitions on torture.
[(Republicans, 'NORP'), (Democrats, 'NORP'), (Mukasey, 'PERSON'), (US, 'GPE')]
Without ever naming waterboarding or other alleged techniques, Bush insisted in a speech to a conservative think tank in Washington that: "The procedures used in this program are safe, they are lawful and they are necessary."
[(Bush, 'PERSON'), (Washington, 'GPE')]
"It's wrong for congressional leaders to make Judge Mukasey's confirmation dependent on his willingness to go on the record about the details of a classified program he has not been briefed on," the president said.
[(Mukasey, 'PERSON')]
He said Mukasey, who has called the practice personally "repugnant," also cannot answer because his reply might place US interrogators "in legal jeopardy" and might help terrorists train to resist US questioning.
[(Mukasey, 'PERSON'), (US, 'GPE'), (US, 'GPE')]
As he spoke, Bush's 2004 White House rival, Democratic Senator John Kerry, said he would vote against Mukasey over his "refusal to classify the barbaric practice of waterboarding as torture."
[(Bush, 'PERSON'), (2004, 'DATE'), (White House, 'ORG'), (Democratic, 'NORP'), (John Kerry, 'PERSON'), (Mukasey, 'PERSON')]
"I am not comfortable confirming anyone who cannot see that this method of interrogation is antithetical to American values and traditions -- especially not to a position that is charged with representing our entire justice system," Kerry said in a statement.
[(American, 'NORP'), (Kerry, 'PERSON')]
Bush's comments came after a growing number of Democratic Senators, including top presidential candidates, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, Chris Dodd and Joseph Biden, come out against the nomination.
[(Bush, 'PERSON'), (Democratic Senators, 'ORG'), (Hillary Clinton, 'PERSON'), (Barack Obama, 'PERSON'), (Chris Dodd, 'PERSON'), (Joseph Biden, 'PERSON')]
Veteran Senator Edward Kennedy was the latest to reject Mukasey, in a Senate speech on Thursday.
[(Edward Kennedy, 'PERSON'), (Mukasey, 'PERSON'), (Senate, 'ORG'), (Thursday, 'DATE')]
"This is a nomination I had hoped to support," said Kennedy, but added he could not do so because of the interrogations issue.
[(Kennedy, 'PERSON')]
"Waterboarding is torture, yet Judge Mukasey refuses to say so," he said.
[(Mukasey, 'PERSON')]
The attorney general of the United States must also be a person with an unbending commitment to justice, fairness, and equality, who will stand up for America's laws and values, even when the White House tries to steer the department in the other direction.
[(the United States, 'GPE'), (America, 'GPE'), (the White House, 'ORG')]
Another senior Democrat, Senator Chuck Schumer, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee refused to say whether he would back the nomination.
[(Democrat, 'NORP'), (Chuck Schumer, 'PERSON'), (the Senate Judiciary Committee, 'ORG')]
"I am weighing this issue very carefully," he told reporters, adding "I don't think Democrats are mistreating him."
[(Democrats, 'NORP')]
Mukasey's fate appears to hinge on gaining the support of a single Democratic senator, to match the votes of all the Republicans on the Judiciary committee, to send the nomination to the full Senate floor.
[(Mukasey, 'PERSON'), (Democratic, 'NORP'), (Republicans, 'NORP'), (Senate, 'ORG')]
A vote is expected in the committee on November 6.

[(Bush, 'PERSON'), (Iraq, 'GPE'), (Democratic, 'NORP'), (Clinton, 'PERSON'), (Democrats, 'NORP'), (September 11, 2001, 'DATE')]
His rhetorical broadside came as a Malcolm Nance, a former master instructor in the US Navy's Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape School (SERE), which trains US forces to resist brutal interrogation practices like waterboarding, wrote in the New York Daily news that it is undoubtedly torture.
[(Malcolm Nance, 'PERSON'), (the US Navy's, 'ORG'), (Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape School, 'WORK_OF_ART'), (US, 'GPE'), (the New York Daily, 'ORG')]

However, when performed on an unsuspecting prisoner, waterboarding is a torture technique -- without a doubt.

Countryside could be eaten by 2100
[(2100, 'CARDINAL')]
Urban growth and the development of power stations, roads and airports could swallow up what is left of England's undisturbed countryside by the end of the century, campaigners warned.
[(Urban, 'ORG'), (England, 'GPE'), (the end of the century, 'DATE')]
Already 50% of the land in England is disturbed by noise, light and spoiled views by urban areas and major infrastructure, maps published by the Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE) showed.
[(50%, 'PERCENT'), (England, 'GPE'), (the Campaign to Protect Rural England, 'ORG'), (CPRE, 'ORG')]
The South East is all but disappearing under development, with 70% of the region affected and the remaining 30% set to be blighted in just 45 years under current rates of growth, the CPRE said.
[(The South East, 'LOC'), (70%, 'PERCENT'), (the remaining 30%, 'PERCENT'), (just 45 years, 'DATE'), (CPRE, 'ORG')]

Doctors cleared over blood scandal
[]
A judge has acquitted three doctors, a New Jersey company and a former Red Cross official of criminal charges in a tainted-blood scandal that infected thousands of Canadians with HIV or hepatitis C and resulted in more than 3,000 deaths.
[(three, 'CARDINAL'), (New Jersey, 'GPE'), (Red Cross, 'ORG'), (thousands, 'CARDINAL'), (Canadians, 'NORP'), (more than 3,000, 'CARDINAL')]
Ontario Superior Court Justice Mary Lou Benotto ruled that the defendants did not show conduct displaying wanton and reckless disregard in the use of the blood and that there was no marked departure from the standards of a reasonable person.
[(Ontario Superior Court, 'ORG'), (Mary Lou Benotto, 'PERSON')]
The case involved blood products produced by New Jersey-based Armour Pharmaceutical in the 1980s and early 1990s that turned out to be infected.

[]
The other doctors and the drug company also pleaded not guilty.
[]
Defence lawyers argued that prosecutors did not present enough evidence to prove their case.
[]
In her ruling, Mrs Justice Benotto told the court: "The conduct examined in detail over one and a half years confirms reasonable and responsible and professional actions and responses during this difficult time," she said.
[(one and a half years, 'DATE')]

South Korea spy unit admits kidnapping Nobel winner

Finally, an Environment-Friendly Solution for Insect Control is Available to California Growers
[(Available, 'ORG'), (California Growers, 'ORG')]
10 /PRNewswire/ -- An environment-friendly technology is now available to control mealybugs, aphids, scale, whitefly and other homoptera that cause major damage to citrus, grape, almond and numerous other important crops.
[(10, 'CARDINAL')]
When the Argentine ants and other damaging insects are eliminated, the lady bugs, parasitic wasps and other predatory beneficial insects are allowed to return and feed on the homoptera.
[(Argentine, 'NORP')]
This is all accomplished without the broadcast spraying of highly-toxic pesticides that are harmful to humans and all other living beings.
[]
The self-contained, KM AntPro liquid insect-activated dispensing system, combined with Gourmet Liquid Ant Bait (1% boric acid solution), has proven highly successful in University of California studies, and in over five years of use in residential, commercial and other non-agricultural applications, eliminating Argentine ants and other ant species infestations.
[(Gourmet Liquid Ant Bait, 'ORG'), (1%, 'PERCENT'), (University of California, 'ORG'), (over five years, 'DATE'), (Argentine, 'NORP')]
The foraging ants, after feeding within the rugged weather-sheltered dispenser, transfer the low-toxicity, liquid bait back to their nests thus feeding the queens and workers, thereby, eliminating the total colony without compromising the environment.
[]
Both the patented AntPro dispenser and Gourmet Liquid Ant Bait have been determined organic crop compliant by the Guaranteed Organic Certification Agency (GOCA), a USDA accredited certification agency located in Temecula, CA. and in July, 2006, Gourmet Liquid Ant Bait received a supplemental labeling for special local need approval by the State of California (Section 24-c) for its use with organically grown fruit and nut crops.

In this report, vendors were evaluated by Gartner on the basis of their ability to execute and completeness of vision.
[(Gartner, 'PERSON')]
According to Gartner, "Visionaries invest in the leading-edge features that will be significant in the next generation of products and that will give buyers early access to improved security and management."
[(Gartner, 'PERSON')]
Sentillion proVision is a comprehensive, enterprise-class user provisioning solution, which is purpose-built to address the unique requirements of the healthcare market.
[]
In healthcare, the need for a provisioning solution is paramount because the process of creating and managing user accounts for clinical, business and personal productivity applications presents more challenges than in any other industry.
[(healthcare, 'ORG')]
Since most users fulfill several different job functions at different times using a myriad of highly specialized, departmental applications, a healthcare provisioning solution must address both productivity and compliance.
[]
"We are extremely pleased that Gartner has positioned Sentillion in the visionaries quadrant in the provisioning market," said Paul Roscoe, president of worldwide sales and marketing for Sentillion.
[(Gartner, 'PERSON'), (Sentillion, 'ORG'), (Paul Roscoe, 'PERSON'), (Sentillion, 'ORG')]
In my opinion, this is further confirmation of Sentillion's commitment to healthcare to innovate and deliver solutions that are purpose-built to help overcome the complex and time intensive challenges that burden this industry.
[(Sentillion, 'ORG')]
It is our dedication to the healthcare market, in my opinion, which has established Sentillion as an industry leader.
[(Sentillion, 'ORG')]
With proVision, caregivers can be up, running and productive on a healthcare organization's information systems on the first day of their residency, staff assignment or upon receiving admitting privileges.
[(the first day, 'DATE')]
And from a compliance standpoint, when a user leaves the organization or changes roles, proVision uniformly alters, disables, or terminates their access to systems and applications. proVision is presently used by healthcare organizations across North America to administer more than 125,000 managed identities.
[(North America, 'LOC'), (more than 125,000, 'CARDINAL')]
According to David Finn, vice president and CIO of Texas Children's Hospital, "Other vendors we considered just didn't understand provisioning as it relates to clinical applications.
[(David Finn, 'PERSON'), (CIO of Texas Children's Hospital, 'ORG')]
When we spoke to Sentillion we were very impressed.
[]
They were not only speaking our language but they really understood the unique challenges of healthcare provisioning.

Five areas to pilot bin charges
[(Five, 'CARDINAL')]
Powers to allow local councils to give financial incentives to encourage recycling - and issue fines for those who do not - were included in the Climate Change Bill.
[]
Under proposals outlined earlier this year, households which recycle the most could get an annual discount of up to £50, while those which recycle the least could be charged up to £50.
[(earlier this year, 'DATE'), (annual, 'DATE'), (up to £50, 'MONEY'), (50, 'MONEY')]
The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) announced on Thursday that a maximum of five pilot schemes would be allowed, and their success would be judged before they are rolled out more widely.
[(The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, 'ORG'), (Defra, 'PERSON'), (Thursday, 'DATE'), (five, 'CARDINAL')]
But those applying to pilot a scheme have to have "checks and balances" - like a fly-tipping prevention strategy and good kerbside recycling services - and ensure any money raised is paid back to residents overall.
[]
In a Parliamentary statement, waste and recycling minister Joan Ruddock said: "The case for reducing the amount of waste we all produce is clear - it is damaging the environment and contributing to climate change.
[(Joan Ruddock, 'PERSON')]
Furthermore it makes no financial sense to keep dumping it into holes in the ground.

But it says the start-up costs, estimated at £100,000-£200,000 and running costs of up to £500,000 a year for a 50,000 household scheme, will be borne by local authorities.
