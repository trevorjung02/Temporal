Ohio: Blast Destroys Warehouse - New York Times

An explosion leveled a storage warehouse at an industrial plant in Ravenna and shook the ground more than a mile away, officials said.
(Ravenna,)
Fire officials did not know what caused the explosion at Griswold Manufacturing.
(Griswold Manufacturing,)
The plant, which punches holes in metal products, has 117 employees, all off because of Labor Day, City Councilman Joe Bica said: It is a godsend that this was a holiday.

Manhattan: Officer Admits Endangering Child
(Manhattan,)
A city police officer pleaded guilty yesterday to sexual abuse and endangering the welfare of a child as his trial got under way in State Supreme Court.
(yesterday, State Supreme Court)
The officer, Robert Friedrich, 31, agreed to resign from the police force and register as a low-level sex offender, and Justice William Wetzel promised him a sentence of probation, probably six years.
(Robert Friedrich, 31, William Wetzel, six years)
Officer Friedrich admitted sending sexually suggestive text messages to a 13-year-old girl and to kissing her with his tongue.

His plea came moments before the girl and her mother were scheduled to take the witness stand on the first day of testimony.
(moments, the first day)
Prosecutors had shown the jury text messages from the officer indicating that he had instigated the relationship and that he knew she was, as he put it, "technically a minor."

Officer Friedrich, on the police force for six years, was assigned to the Manhattan South Task Force.

If I Only Knew When I Tasted It
()
My last post was a somewhat scattershot effort that touched on Barolo, a recent article in The New Yorker on the Jefferson bottles and my Wines of The Times column on Cornas.
(Barolo, The New Yorker, Jefferson, Times, Cornas)
It drew a number of comments, and I want to respond to one of them right here.
(one,)
Steve, in comment No.
(Steve,)
13, complains that in my Cornas column I said that the 2004 from Auguste Clape, perhaps the most revered vigneron in Cornas, did not make our list of the top 10 bottles, but I did not explain why.
(13, Cornas, 2004, Auguste Clape, Cornas, 10)
"Absent some clarification,"" he writes, "I'm afraid you are perpetuating a point of view that I don't believe you intend to: that wine, even newly released Cornas, should be enjoyable upon release.
(Cornas,)
We all know where that leads.""
()
Steve is absolutely right.
(Steve,)
I should have explained.
()
In fact, I did, but the explanation ended up on the cutting room floor due to the infernally tight space requirements of the physical newspaper.
()
Here is what I intended to say:
()
The 2004 from Auguste Clape, a towering figure in Cornas, did not make the cut, which I think says more about the deficiencies of blind tasting than of this particular wine.
(2004, Auguste Clape, Cornas)
It was rugged, as is typical of young Clape.
()
In retrospect the violet and licorice aromas peeking from underneath the tannins gave a hint, I think, of what's to come.""
()
Even that explanation is too short and a bit coded, but here's what I mean.
()
We all know about the benefits of blind tastings: they supposedly remove from the judging equation whatever preconceptions you have about different producers and their wines.
()
These preconceptions and expectations can powerfully affect your perception of the wines (just read The New Yorker column if you don't believe me!).
(The New Yorker,)
But blind tastings also have disadvantages.
()
They eliminate knowledge and context that can be significant in judging a wine.
()
In the case of the Clape wine, I think my judgment would have benefited from being able to place that bottle in the context of what I know about the history and characteristics of that estate.
(Clape,)
Fairly or unfairly, wine experts are expected to be able to judge a wine simply by tasting what's in the glass in the course of tasting many other wines.
()
Personally, I feel it's a little like judging a book by reading one chapter or one page, but you can't do away with mass tastings altogether.
(one, one)
Speaking of books, why are book critics permitted to know who wrote what they are reading?
()
Why are film critics expected to know all about the director and to use that knowledge when they judge a film?
()
Don't we think their objectivity will be compromised in the same way?
()
Or is it that wine writers are not accorded the same level of respect, since the public assumes their perceptions will be compromised if they know what they are tasting?
()
Maybe it's time to think about wine assessments in another way.
()
Twenty-five or 30 years ago, it was a different world.
(Twenty-five, 30 years ago)
Wine writers like Robert M. Parker Jr. had to demonstrate dramatically that wines from upstart producers and undervalued regions could compete with the established names.
(Robert M. Parker Jr.,)
Blind tasting was one way of doing so, and now it has become the convention.
(one,)
But maybe as wine drinkers we're all a little more grown up now and don't need to taste blind all the time.
()
I think in certain contexts like the Cornas tasting, a little more knowledge brought to bear on the subject would have been useful.
(Cornas,)
Now, there are other contexts where tasting blind can be useful.
()
For instance, next week in the newspaper I'm going to write about a tasting of wines for under $10 a bottle.
(next week, 10)
In that case, where we dealt with many little-known producers and wines from many different regions, it was educational to taste blind.
()
We're not going to set aside blind tasting.
()
At least, not yet.
()
But I think it's time to consider whether it's always the best way to judge wines.
()
Consider the question asked.

Fisk University - Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art - Alfred Stieglitz Collection - Art - New York Times
(Fisk University - Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art - Alfred Stieglitz Collection - Art - New York Times,)
25  Fisk Universitys board of trustees has agreed in principle to share ownership of its prized Alfred Stieglitz Collection with the new Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Arkansas in exchange for $30 million, the two sides announced on Tuesday.
(25 , Fisk Universitys, Alfred Stieglitz Collection, Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art, Arkansas, $30 million, two, Tuesday)
The agreement, subject to approval by a chancery court judge, would entitle the university and the museum to display the 101 works in the collection for equal amounts of time, they said.
(101,)
Crystal Bridges is scheduled to open in Bentonville, Ark., in 2009.
(Crystal Bridges, Bentonville, Ark., 2009)
The founder of Crystal Bridges, the Wal-Mart heiress Alice L. Walton, also pledged $1 million to renovate and maintain the Fisk gallery that houses the collection and to finance an art internship.
(Crystal Bridges, Wal-Mart, Alice L. Walton, $1 million, Fisk)
The boards vote on Monday, which came after more than a year of litigation over the fate of the artworks, could help remedy Fisks financial problems, the universitys board said.
(Monday, more than a year, the universitys board)
This settlement represents a great opportunity for Fisk to emerge from this lengthy and complicated process on the strongest financial footing that we have been on in decades, Reynaldo P. Glover, the board chairman, said in a statement.
(Fisk, Reynaldo P. Glover)
Still, the fate of the art-sharing agreement is far from certain.
()
The Tennessee attorney general, Robert E. Cooper Jr., who has a say because the collection was a charitable donation, must still weigh in; he has said he would prefer that the collection remain full time in Nashville, where Fisk is based.
(Tennessee, Robert E. Cooper Jr., Nashville, Fisk)
Georgia OKeeffe, widow of the photographer Alfred Stieglitz, gave 97 of the pieces in the Stieglitz Collection to Fisk in 1949, and donated more several years later.
(Georgia OKeeffe, Alfred Stieglitz, 97, the Stieglitz Collection, Fisk, 1949, several years later)
Other works from Stieglitzs enormous collection went to institutions including the National Gallery and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.
(the National Gallery, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York)
Fisk sought court permission in late 2005 to sell two works from the collection  Radiator Building  Night, New York, a striking Precisionist canvas from 1927, by OKeeffe, and Marsden Hartleys Painting No.
(Fisk, late 2005, two, Building  Night, Precisionist, 1927, Marsden Hartleys)
3  to boost the universitys sagging endowment.
(3,)
But the Georgia OKeeffe Museum in Santa Fe, N.M., which functions as OKeeffes estate, filed suit to block the sale, arguing that Fisk was violating its agreement with OKeeffe to maintain the collection.
(the Georgia OKeeffe Museum, Santa Fe, N.M., Fisk)
In a proposed legal settlement this year the museum agreed to buy Radiator Building for $7.5 million, and allow Fisk to sell the Hartley work.
(this year, $7.5 million, Fisk, Hartley)
While that settlement was pending, Crystal Bridges made its $30 million offer to share the collection.
(Crystal Bridges, $30 million)
Citing the value of that bid, a chancery court judge rejected Fisks settlement with the Georgia OKeeffe Museum this month, saying it was not advantageous to the people of Tennessee.
(the Georgia OKeeffe Museum, this month, Tennessee)
Then the OKeeffe Museum dropped its suit, saying it did not want to pose further difficulties for the university.
(the OKeeffe Museum,)
In her ruling the chancery court judge, Chancellor Ellen Hobbs Lyle, made clear that she considered the Crystal Bridges offer to be superior to the settlement.
(Ellen Hobbs Lyle, Crystal Bridges)
But the latest deal could renew debate in the case over what is best for Fisk and for Tennesseans, who would have diminished access to the collection under the proposal, some experts in art law suggest.
(Fisk, Tennesseans)
If you step back, and your test is whats in the best interest of the people of the State of Tennessee, I dont see how you do this without putting it up for bid, said Donn Zaretsky, a lawyer in New York who specializes in art law. Thats the only way to know for sure.
(Tennessee, Donn Zaretsky, New York)
The Georgia OKeeffe Museum had previously pledged to oppose the deal.
(The Georgia OKeeffe Museum,)
But on Tuesday the president of the museums board, Saul Cohen, appeared to soften that stance, saying that Crystal Bridges had sweetened its original overture with the addition of the internship and the $1 million renovation.
(Tuesday, Saul Cohen, Crystal Bridges, $1 million)
He said the OKeeffe Museum needed to examine the details of the agreement, also noting that the offer might not be as financially advantageous to Fisk as it appeared.
(the OKeeffe Museum, Fisk)
Thirty million is a real bargain price for ownership of half the collection, Mr. Cohen said.
(Thirty million, half, collection,, Cohen)
In addition to American modernist works, the collection includes pieces by Picasso, Renoir and Cézanne.
(American, Picasso, Renoir, Cézanne)
Fisks case is one of several nationally in which small, financially ailing colleges and universities have sought to leverage the value of their art collections to bolster their endowments and even stave off closing.

In Lynchburg, Va., Randolph College is seeking to sell or share some of its $100 million collection, which includes works by Edward Hopper, OKeeffe and William Merritt Chase, to improve its finances.
(Lynchburg, Va., Randolph College, $100 million, Edward Hopper, William Merritt Chase)
Acting with the National Gallery of Art in Washington, Crystal Bridges also tried to buy one of Thomas Eakinss best-known paintings, The Gross Clinic, from Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia for $68 million.
(the National Gallery of Art, Washington, Crystal Bridges, Thomas Eakinss, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, $68 million)

U.S. Needs "Long-Term Presence" in Iraq, Gates Says
(U.S., Iraq, Gates)
26  Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates told Congress on Wednesday that he envisioned keeping five combat brigades in Iraq as a long-term presence.
(26, Defense, Robert M. Gates, Congress, Wednesday, five, Iraq)
Mr. Gates told the Senate Appropriations Committee, When I speak of a long-term presence, Im thinking of a very modest U.S. presence with no permanent bases, where we can continue to go after Al Qaeda in Iraq and help the Iraqi forces.
(Gates, the Senate Appropriations Committee, U.S., Al Qaeda, Iraq, Iraqi)
He added that in my head he envisioned a force as a quarter of the current combat brigades.
()
There are now 20 combat brigades in the country, a number that is scheduled to drop to 15 by next summer.
(20, 15, next summer)
Mr. Gates has previously expressed hope that if security conditions in the country continue to improve, force levels in Iraq could drop to 10 brigades by the end of 2008.
(Gates, Iraq, 10, the end of 2008)
Mr. Gates gave no timetable for reaching that force level or for how long the forces would be required to stay.
(Gates,)
He added that there had been no detailed planning by the Pentagon about what level of forces would be required on a more or less permanent basis.
(Pentagon,)
A combat brigade has 3,500 to 4,500 soldiers, leaving a minimum of 17,500 combat troops in Iraq under the plan Mr. Gates described.
(3,500, 4,500, 17,500, Iraq, Gates)
The total American force required would probably end up being at least twice that, because of the need for support troops and other related personnel.
(American,)
Mr. Gates also laid out at the hearing a Bush administration request for an added $42 billion for war-related expenses in 2008.
(Gates, Bush, $42 billion, 2008)
The request increases to nearly $190 billion the amount the Bush administration is seeking for 2008 to finance military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.
(nearly $190 billion, Bush, 2008, Iraq, Afghanistan)
In February, the administration asked for $141.7 billion for the wars, an amount that officials said at the time was an estimate that could increase.
(February, $141.7 billion)
The Appropriations Committee chairman, Senator Robert C. Byrd, a Democrat from West Virginia, responded with blistering criticism of the administrations Iraq strategy and warned that his panel would not rubber stamp Mr. Bushs requests for war financing.
(Appropriations Committee, Robert C. Byrd, Democrat, West Virginia, Iraq)
The president and his supporters claim that were now finally on the cusp of progress and that we must continue to stay the course, Mr. Byrd said. Ive heard that before.
(course,, Byrd)
Call me a skeptic, but we have heard this tune before.
()
Yes, havent we?
()
Antiwar protesters in the hearing room responded with cries of Yes!
()
Yes!
()
Mr. Byrd later had the room cleared of protesters after they disrupted an answer by Gen. Peter Pace, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
(Byrd, Peter Pace, the Joint Chiefs of Staff)
Mr. Gates said $11 billion of the requested money was for building 15,000 heavily armored vehicles designed to better withstand the roadside bombs that cause the majority of American casualties in Iraq.
(Gates, $11 billion, 15,000, American, Iraq)
The Pentagon also seeks $9 billion to repair and refit American equipment stocks.
(Pentagon, $9 billion, American)
The administration is also requesting $1 billion to train Iraqi security forces, bringing the total 2008 request for training funds to $5.7 billion.
($1 billion, Iraqi, 2008, $5.7 billion)
But Mr. Gates said that American troops, under some of the most trying conditions, have done far more than what was asked of them, and far more than what was expected.

There is always unusual expectation for Nicolas Ghesquiere's Balenciaga show, held at 10 a.m., on the Tuesday of the Paris collections, in the same small space on the Left Bank, with photographers crowding the sidewalk and locals wondering, "What gives?"

When the show started, with Vivaldi's "Four Seasons," it was confirmed that Ghesquiere was moving away from the street-influenced patterns and decoration of fall.
(Vivaldi, Four Seasons)
Shape, cutting, and special fabrics defined this collection, predominantly in vivid floral prints and in old-fashioned couture fabrics as well as high-tech synthetics like foam.
()
The show was full of thought and invention, particularly in the laser cutting of fabrics and the blending of seemingly 18th-century shapes and a modernist sensibility.

Some of the prints come from the Balenciaga archive and were reinterpreted.
()
Ghesquiere's vision seems incredibly precise and clear, maybe more than ever.

A TV interviewer said to me afterward that she supposed some women will wear the short hemlines with black tights.
()
But this is not a pragmatic collection.
()
It is a strong fashion statement.

It is what designers of Ghesquiere's caliber are supposed to do - push our imaginations with the techniques and materials available to them.

2 Iraqi Women Killed in Shooting by Security Convoy
(2, Iraqi)
BAGHDAD, Oct. 9 - Two women died here on Tuesday when their white Oldsmobile was riddled by automatic gunfire from guards for a private security company, just weeks after a shooting by another company strained relations between the United States and Iraq.
(BAGHDAD, Oct. 9 - Two, Tuesday, just weeks, the United States, Iraq)
The guards involved in the Tuesday shooting were working for an Australian-run security company.
(Tuesday, Australian)
But the people they were assigned to protect work under the same United States government agency whose security guards sprayed bullets across a crowded Baghdad square on Sept.
(United States, Baghdad, Sept.)
16, an episode that caused an uproar among Iraqi officials and is still being investigated by the United States.
(16, Iraqi, the United States)
In the Tuesday shooting, as many as 40 bullets struck the car, killing the driver and the woman in the front seat on the passenger side.
(Tuesday, as many as 40)
A woman and a boy in the back seat survived, according to witnesses and local police officials in the Karada neighborhood, where the shooting took place on a boulevard lined with appliance stores, tea shops and money changers.
(Karada,)
American government officials said the guards had been hired to protect financial and policy experts working for an organization under contract with the United States Agency for International Development, a quasi-independent State Department agency that does extensive aid work in Iraq.
(American, the United States Agency, International Development, State Department, Iraq)
The organization, RTI International, is in Iraq to carry out what is ultimately a State Department effort to improve local government and democratic institutions.
(RTI International, Iraq, State Department)
But a Bush administration official said the State Department bore no responsibility for overseeing RTI's security operations.
(Bush, the State Department, RTI)
"A.I.D. does not direct the security arrangements of its contractors," the official said.
()
These groups are contractually responsible for the safety and security of their employees.
()
That responsibility falls entirely on the contractor.
()
A priest and relatives near the scene said that all of the people in the car were Armenian Christians, who make up a small minority group in Iraq.
(Armenian Christians, Iraq)
The Oldsmobile was shot once in the radiator, witnesses said, in front of a plumbing supply store as it approached a convoy of white sport utility vehicles 50 yards away.
(50 yards,)
As the car kept rolling, a barrage of gunfire suddenly tore through its hood, roof and windshield, as well as the passenger side.
()
The guards who were in the convoy work for Unity Resources Group, an Australian-run company that has its headquarters in Dubai and is registered in Singapore, according to a statement by the company.
(Unity Resources Group, Australian, Dubai, Singapore)
Unity Resources was hired by RTI to provide security in Iraq.
(RTI, Iraq)
In its statement, Unity Resources said that according to its initial information, the car had approached the convoy "at speed" and failed to stop in response to hand signals and a warning flare.
(Unity Resources,)
"Finally shots were fired at the vehicle and it stopped," the company said.
()
The episode's connection with the United States Agency for International Development is one of several parallels to the Sept.
(the United States Agency, International Development, one, Sept.)
16 shootings, in which the Iraqi government says 17 Iraqis died and 27 were wounded.
(16, Iraqi, 17, Iraqis, 27)
16 episode began when a convoy operated by Blackwater USA, an American private security company hired to protect the aid agency's officials, entered Nisour Square in central Baghdad and fired several bullets toward a car the guards apparently considered a threat.
(16, Blackwater USA, American, Nisour Square, Baghdad)
In the Tuesday shooting, like the one on Sept.
(Tuesday, Sept.)
16, the car drifted forward after the initial burst, prompting guards to unleash a barrage of gunfire.
(16,)
And there were no government officials or policy experts in either of the convoys: the Nisour Square convoy was controlling traffic as part of a larger operation, and the convoy in Karada was on a routine movement that involved only security guards, according to American officials.
(Karada, American)
Although the United States Embassy in Baghdad has said almost nothing about the Nisour Square episode while an American investigation grinds on, the Iraqi government has said its own investigation concluded that the shootings were an act of "deliberate murder" and called on the Blackwater guards to be prosecuted.
(the United States Embassy, Baghdad, the Nisour Square, American, Iraqi)
Ali Jafar, a traffic policeman posted near the Karada shooting, said he thought the similarities between the cases were undeniable.
(Ali Jafar, Karada)
"They are killing the people just like what happened in Nisour Square," Mr. Jafar said.
(Nisour Square, Jafar)
They are butchering the Iraqis.
(Iraqis,)
The new shootings happened at an extremely difficult time for the State Department, which relies heavily on Blackwater to protect its diplomats whenever they work outside the fortified Green Zone.
(the State Department, Green Zone)
As a result of new restrictions placed on Blackwater after the Nisour Square shootings, the State Department's numerous programs for rebuilding Iraqi government and technical institutions have been seriously hampered.
(the State Department's, Iraqi)
Embassy officials have vowed to continue their operations even as they increase oversight of Blackwater operations.
()
But Tuesday's episode appears to show that the new oversight comes with many loopholes: Unity Resources is not working directly for the State Department, but for RTI International, which has been contracted by the aid agency to provide experts on local governing.
(Tuesday, the State Department, RTI International)
In fact, an American Embassy spokesman said, the State Department has no say in the operations of security companies employed by government contractors.
(American Embassy, the State Department)
"Their contract might be with A.I.D., but that doesn't shed any light on their choice of security contractor," he said.
(A.I.D.,)
A spokesman for Unity Resources, Martin Simich, said Tuesday that he was unsure whether the guards involved in the shooting had been interviewed by American authorities.
(Unity Resources, Martin Simich, Tuesday, American)
On Tuesday, the convoy of white S.U.V."s was stopped in the eastbound lane of Karada Street at an intersection with an alley lined with low concrete homes, witnesses said.
(Tuesday,)
A man who works at the plumbing shop, who gave his name only as Muhammad, said the Oldsmobile was approaching the convoy from behind.
(Muhammad,)
He said he heard no warnings.
()
Two witnesses said they heard a single shot first, which apparently punctured the Oldsmobile's radiator, spilling coolant onto the street about 50 yards from where the convoy was parked.
(Two, first, Oldsmobile, about 50 yards)
As the car continued rolling, the guards opened up with a barrage of sustained automatic fire.
()
The car finally came to a stop about 10 yards from the convoy at a point that, three hours later, was marked by blood stains, broken glass and tufts of brown hair.
(about 10 yards, three hours later)
The plumbing shop employee said the convoy moved out right away, without checking to see what damage had been done or to offer medical help.
()
The Oldsmobile was towed to a nearby police station.
()
The priest and relatives near the scene identified the driver as Maruni Uhanees, 59, and the dead passenger as Jeniva Jalal, 30.
(Maruni Uhanees, 59, Jeniva Jalal, 30)
As twilight set in, family members gathered beside the car in a dirt alley outside the police station, staring at the blood and hair on the inside of the windshield.

A brother-in-law of the driver, Hrair Vartanian, said Ms. Uhanees was the mother of three grown daughters.

Indias stock markets cratered this morning on the news, but regained ground in the afternoon as market makers turned their attention to the countrys stalwart economic growth.
(this morning, the afternoon)
The Bombay Stock Exchanges Sensex Index tumbled as much as 9.15 percent soon after opening today, prompting regulators to halt trading for an hour.
(The Bombay Stock, as much as 9.15 percent, today, an hour)
But the index regained most of that ground in later trading, closing down 1.76 percent on the day.

Many economists and brokers in India welcomed SEBIs announcement, saying regulators need to impose more financial discipline.
(India,)
Indias regulators needed to put a filter on the hot money coming to this market, said Dinesh Thakkar, the managing director of Angel Broking. SEBI had to protect investors who are interested in the long run.

Indias markets have enjoyed unprecedented appreciation in recent weeks, becoming some of the best performing markets in Asia, after foreign investors piled in, some looking for refuge from Americas housing market problems.

In addition to inflating stock market values, foreign investment is being credited with a more than 12 percent increase in the rupee. Exporters are hurting and there are concerns about job losses in jewelry, textile, footwear and leather industries, Goldman Sachs said in a report today.
(more than 12 percent, Goldman Sachs, today)
The SEBI proposal would ban any foreign investors who are not registered with the regulator from issuing participatory notes, an offshore derivative instrument that institutions use to anonymously buy Indian stock, for themselves or clients.
(Indian,)
About half of all foreign investment in Indias equity markets is made through participatory notes.
(About half,)
Foreign investors are drawn to these instruments because they allow them to skip the time-consuming registration process required to buy stock directly on Indias markets, and because they are cheaper.
()
Big banks and funds tend to register directly with SEBI, but banks also issue participatory notes for smaller institutions like hedge funds and investment funds.
()
There were some $89.8 billion in so-called participatory notes outstanding in August of this year, up from $8.1 billion in March of 2004.
(some $89.8 billion, August of this year, $8.1 billion, March of 2004)
The proposal also bans foreign institutions from issuing any participatory notes backed by derivatives, and requires them to wind up any derivative positions over the next 18 months.
(the next 18 months,)
JP Morgan estimates that could effect some $3.6 to $5.4 billion currently invested in Indias markets.
(JP Morgan, some $3.6 to $5.4 billion)
Government officials have been scrutinizing the year on year increase in offshore derivative instruments, the anonymity they provide and the copious inflows into the country from foreign investors, SEBI said in its statement.

SEBI has asked for market participants to comment on their proposal by October 20.
(October 20,)
The proposal has the backing of the Reserve Bank of India and the Ministry of Finance and is expected to pass, said several market participants.
(the Reserve Bank of India, the Ministry of Finance)
Hedge funds and small investing groups have been attracted to Indias high growth in recent months, and some of these investors may leave the markets. It will depend on the nature of the investor, said JP Morgan Chases Mr. Malik. If someone wants exposure to the Indian markets, they have no choice but to go through the registration process.
(recent months, It, Morgan Chases, Malik, Indian)
The move will take some of the wind out of the sails of Indias markets in the short term, but is unlikely to have a long term effect, said Mark Monson, a senior fund manager with Raiffeisen Capital Management, a Vienna-based fund which has about 420 million euros invested in India.
(Mark Monson, Raiffeisen Capital Management, Vienna, about 420 million, India)
Ive been involved with India for many many years, he said, and well be involved with India for many many years,

Many market participants said that while the SEBI proposal was a step in the right direction, they are not happy with how it was being carried out.
()
Investors say the registration process can take three to six months, and is often delayed by layers of bureaucracy.
(three to six months,)
You need to create alternative avenues for investors, or speed up the process for direct registration, said Tushar Poddar, a vice president with Goldman Sachs.

Investors use participatory notes to avoid the trouble of registering with Indian regulators, said Hugh Young, managing director in Aberdeen Asset Management, which is a registered investor in India and does not rely on participatory notes.

The biggest effect will be on investors who just couldnt be bloody well bothered to do the paperwork, he said.

A Yiddish Revival, With New York Leading the Way
(New York,)
The question was bound to come up at some point: Vifl fun aykh do redn yidish?
(redn yidish?,)
How many of you here speak Yiddish?
(Yiddish,)
About half of the audience raised their hands - some after a moment's hesitation.
(About half,)
The audience had gathered Tuesday evening in the basement auditorium at the Museum of the City of New York for a panel discussion, "Yiddish Is Alive and Well and Living in New York," that traced the language's rich history and future prospects.
(Tuesday evening, the Museum of the City of New York, Yiddish Is Alive and Well and Living in New York)
In the 20th century alone, Yiddish, once a thriving language spoken by millions of Eastern European Jews, became something of an endangered tongue, its legacy maintained by scattered communities in North America and the Soviet Union.
(the 20th century, Yiddish, millions, Eastern European, North America, the Soviet Union)
Now Yiddish is undergoing what many see as a revival.
(Yiddish,)
Jeffrey Shandler, associate professor of Jewish studies at Rutgers University and author of "Adventures in Yiddishland: Postvernacular Language and Culture" (University of California Press, 2005), moderated the panel, which was presented as part of an exhibition, "The Jewish Daily Forward: Embracing an Immigrant Community."
(Jeffrey Shandler, Jewish, Rutgers University, University of California Press, 2005)
Acknowledging Yiddish's "very long and often very fraught past," Dr. Shandler began by saying, "We often measure the state of a language and culture against the past, especially the period immediately before World War II, when Yiddish is the most widely spoken of any Jewish language in history and is the center of a vernacular culture of unprecedented scope in the Jewish experience."
(Shandler, World War II, Yiddish, Jewish, Jewish)
He encouraged the speakers to "focus on what contemporary culture is more so than what it isn't."
()
The first was Adrienne Cooper, a Yiddish singer who directs external affairs at the Workmen's Circle, a mutual-aid society that promotes Jewish culture.
(first, Adrienne Cooper, Yiddish, Jewish)
Ms. Cooper, a mezzo-soprano, comes from a family of performers.
(Cooper,)
"I was literate and understood my mother's songs well before I spoke Yiddish, which is when I was in graduate school," she said.
(Yiddish,)
The Workmen's Circle, whose mission is secular, invests heavily in Yiddish teaching resources, like college textbooks and songbooks.
(Yiddish,)
"There are family learning communities that are primarily organized to teach children, but also to teach and engage the parents using the family heritage of Ashkenazi Jews - this personal, received history, rooted in the language, as the emotional hook to their using Yiddish for their Jewish literacy," she said.
(Ashkenazi, Yiddish, Jewish)
Ms. Cooper also noted that the American Jewish World Service ran a program to help revive Yiddish language and culture in Russia, acknowledging that there were Russian Jews who had no intention of ever moving to Israel, the United States or elsewhere.
(Cooper, the American Jewish World Service, Russia, Russian, Israel, the United States)
"The way to support them is not to make them into Lubavitcher Hasidim, is not to make them Zionists, but to look at the culture that was indigenous there and help repair that thread of Yiddish culture," she said.
(Lubavitcher Hasidim, Zionists, Yiddish)
Over the last decade, Americans with an interest in Yiddish -- many of them descendants of Russian immigrants -- have traveled to Russia to "repair that break" in culture, she said.
(the last decade, Americans, Yiddish, Russian, Russia)
"People became fluent in Yiddish very quickly, new Yiddish creators began to write songs," she said.
(Yiddish, Yiddish)
There was a cultural courage and ownership that actually took a lot longer to develop among klezmer revivalists in the States.
(klezmer, States)
This was a super-heated kiln, and it happened much faster in R than it did here.
()
Ms. Cooper, who recorded "Ghetto Tango," an album of wartime cabaret music, with the pianist Zalmen Mlotek, described her love of Yiddish eloquently:
(Cooper, Ghetto Tango, Zalmen Mlotek, Yiddish)
I've heard the language since birth.
()
It's a language that bites back.
()
It's tender and folksy and intelligent and ironic and rooted historically in a territory.
()
That resonates with me because of family history and experience, but I also am a big believer that Jewishness flourishes in books, in exile, in the tradition of not being - I don't know exactly how to describe it -- but in the condition of being unsettled.
(Jewishness,)
Next to speak was Itzik Nakhmen Gottesman, a scholar and editor at The Yiddish Forward, a weekly that has experienced a revival in recent years.
(Itzik Nakhmen Gottesman, The Yiddish Forward, weekly, recent years)
Its English-language counterpart, The Jewish Daily Forward, is also published weekly.
(English, The Jewish Daily Forward, weekly)
Dr. Gottesman, who holds a doctorate in Yiddish folklore from the University of Pennsylvania, runs a record label, Yiddishland Records, and is the host of a Saturday night radio show on WMCA-AM (570).
(Gottesman, Yiddish, the University of Pennsylvania, Yiddishland Records, Saturday, night, WMCA-AM, 570)
"It's a Christian station that turns Jewish Saturday night," he explained, eliciting some laughs.
(Christian, Saturday, night)
"Reaction to the radio show is much larger in terms of feedback -- a lot of people obviously can understand Yiddish and enjoy Yiddish music, which is part of the show, than can actually read it," he said.
(Yiddish,)
Dr. Gottesman described the special work environment at The Forward.
(Gottesman,)
"We speak Yiddish the whole day," he said, "We don't speak English.
(Yiddish the whole day, English)
Which is one of the reasons I work there, because I'm actually able to make a living speaking Yiddish all day.
(all day,)
His colleagues include the newspaper's editor, Boris Sandler, a Russian-born essayist and journalist.
(Boris Sandler, Russian)
Dr. Gottesman's cousin Rukhl Schaechter, who grew up near him (their families both lived in Bainbridge Avenue in the Bronx), is the news editor.
(Gottesman, Rukhl Schaechter, Bainbridge Avenue, Bronx)
Other employees include a Russian Jew who became Hasidic and the occasional graduate student from the Jewish Theological Seminary.
(Russian, Hasidic, Jewish)
"We realize people are not going to read Yiddish Forward for the news, although we try to find Jewish news that people won't read in The New York Times," Dr. Gottesman said.
(Jewish, The New York Times, Gottesman)
"But when we do news articles, you can often hear us arguing about, How do you say "global warming" in Yiddish, or any technical terms?
(Yiddish,)
We just throw them out in the air and see what finds a consensus.
()
By all accounts, globale onvaremung is the best translation of global warming.
()
Dr. Gottesman, the author of "Defining the Yiddish Nation: The Jewish Folklorists of Poland" (Wayne State University Press, 2003), said he left academia because he wanted to be "one of the people actually contributing to Yiddish culture from the inside."
(Gottesman, Defining the Yiddish Nation, Poland, Wayne State University Press, 2003, Yiddish)
The final speaker was Michael Wex, author of "Born to Kvetch: Yiddish Language and Culture in All of Its Moods" (2005) and "Just Say Nu: Yiddish for Every Occasion (When English Just Won't Do)," published this month.
(Michael Wex, Born to Kvetch: Yiddish Language and Culture in All of Its Moods, 2005, Just Say Nu: Yiddish for Every Occasion, English, this month)
"I think I'm actually the comic relief for this kind of thing," Mr. Wex said, explaining that grew up in the small town of Lethbridge, Alberta, in western Canada -- a town, he noted, with a sizable Mormon population and "also the only area of Canada that featured the Ku Klux Klan."
(Wex, Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada, Mormon, Canada, the Ku Klux Klan)
The peak of Jewish migration to Canada occurred in the 1920s and 1930s, about 30 to 40 years later than the height of Jewish settlement in the United States.
(Jewish, Canada, the 1920s and 1930s, about 30 to 40 years, Jewish, the United States)
That fact, combined with the postwar immigration of Holocaust survivors, meant that Lethbridge was a town "where every adult Jew was a fluent Yiddish speaker."
(Lethbridge, Jew, Yiddish)
Mr. Wex said his own family was very religious, "which was atypical for the place and the time."
(Wex,)
Most of the Jews in the community were yidn fun a gants yor (Jews from a whole year) -- an idiom for regular, ordinary people, not particularly religious or political.
()
Mr. Wex recalled the Yiddish he heard as a young child in the "50s and "60s, when his grandfather's friends would occasionally depart from the "fairly respectable" Yiddish of interwar Warsaw for coarser local dialects.
(Wex, Yiddish, 50s and ", Warsaw)
"So I got this exposure to a kind of Yiddish that was even then not necessarily the norm," said Mr. Wex, who lives in Toronto.
(Wex, Toronto)
And also to this very odd, rather skewed old-man humor, where these men were not just old, but knew they could get away with damn near anything and would basically do it with the drop of a yarmulke.
()
These were the things that nobody liked -- the kind of stuff we were supposed to be, if not ashamed of -- this was what the high culture was supposed to have displaced.
()
Mr. Wex, who was trained in Old English philology before he devoted himself to writing about Yiddish, added:
(Wex, English, Yiddish)
When I began to get seriously interested in Yiddish, I found there were many people who were doing first-rate work on the sort of high culture or officially recognized folk culture, particularly with respect to music -- which has always been strongly represented in Yiddish.
(Yiddish, first, Yiddish)
One of the things I found wasn't getting the attention it deserved was the sort of demotic aspect of Yiddish.
(One, Yiddish)
Mr. Wex said he became fascinated by the common or ordinary (the Yiddish word is prost) language used in bantering.
(Wex, Yiddish, prost)
"A lot of stuff that looks like plain jokes or bad language is actually very, very deeply rooted in Ashkenazi Jewish history and religious practice," he said, adding that his goal was to "go way, way back in folklore and shine a light not just on what you're actually saying, but the process, the vicissitudes, through which the language and culture have developed."
(Ashkenazi, Jewish)
In a noteworthy moment, Mr. Wex mentioned, by way of example, a Yiddish admonition that translates loosely as "Go defecate on the sea."
(Wex, Yiddish)
The precise verb is not printable here -- in Yiddish or English.
(Yiddish, English)
Mr. Wex explained:
(Wex,)
When you stop to think about what this expression is really saying - and then you remember that Yiddish-speaking Jews lived, for years always surrounded by another population which believed that the main guy in their religion actually was able to balance on water while walking -- you get a whole new way of looking at this.
(Jews, years)
Mr. Wex said he questioned the notion of revitalizing Yiddish because "it didn't need revitalization."
(Wex,)
"What it needed," he continued, "was simply people willing to put themselves forward and assume the burden of doing something about it."
()
Dr. Shandler began the question-and-answer session by asking what was being lost with the gradual passing of the generation that spoke Yiddish in prewar Eastern Europe.
(Shandler, Eastern Europe)
"All of us sometimes are stymied by certain words or phrases," Dr. Gottesman replied.
(Gottesman,)
We're lacking sometimes.
()
Ms. Cooper said: "For me it's an absolutely terrifying moment.
(Cooper,)
The passing of the older generation gives new meaning to the idea of golus -- exile, or more generally insecurity.
()
"There is no home to go back to," she said.
()
There is no secular native environment in which to hear the culture continuously.
()
It's a challenging and quite frightening moment.
()
Mr. Wex said that with the death in February of Mordkhe Schaechter, a noted Yiddish linguist (and Dr. Gottesman's uncle), "we lost the last significant Yiddish linguist who grew up in a Yiddish-speaking world."
(Wex, February, Mordkhe Schaechter, Yiddish, Gottesman, Yiddish, Yiddish)
Mr. Wex raised a broader challenge.
(Wex,)
Yiddish is alive and well in insular, ultra-Orthodox Hasidic communities, but the challenge is - "in the absence of the kind of exclusionary antisemitism that prevailed in Europe and became particularly virulent between the two world wars -- to give people who aren't faced with that a reason to speak this language.
(Yiddish, ultra-Orthodox Hasidic, Europe, two, this language)
To try and give them a sense that they have something to express, for which English is simply insufficient.
(English,)
Dr. Gottesman suggested that there was any number of reasons modern secular Jews might learn Yiddish: an identification with an oppressed people, political idealism or a desire to learn more about the world described by Isaac Bashevis Singer.
(Gottesman, Isaac Bashevis Singer)
The panelists also noted a remarkable surge in interest in Yiddish among gentiles.
(Yiddish,)
Ms. Cooper recalled going to the apartment of a Protestant minister in Chemnitz, Germany, for a Yiddish festival, and encountering young Germans -- fluent in Yiddish -- who questioned her about the subtle distinction between nisht and nit, two words for "not."
(Cooper, Protestant, Chemnitz, Germany, Yiddish, Germans, Yiddish, two)
The audience members asked some questions of their own.
()
One woman complained that more Yiddish was not spoken during the panel.
(One, Yiddish)
Mr. Wex, whose books have done much to popularize Yiddish, emphasized its cultural and humorous dimensions.
(Wex, Yiddish)
"Yiddish is a fantastic way to say no to everything around you, and in a culture where saying no is ever more difficult and fraught with consequences, Yiddish is often there as a great big finger to absolutely everything," he said.
(Yiddish, Yiddish)
The contributions of Yiddish to music, movies and popular culture have galvanized an awareness that Yiddish may yet be able to fill gaps in mainstream culture, he said.
(Yiddish,)
Mr. Wex was asked in Yiddish whether he was Lithuanian or Galician, a reference to a historic rivalry between Jews from different regions in czarist Russia (areas that are part of modern-day Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Ukraine).
(Wex, Yiddish, Russia, modern-day, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Ukraine)
Mr. Wex replied, without skipping a beat, "Yakh bin a poylisher, nisht ken litvak un nisht, got zol ophitn, ken galitsyaner."
(Wex, Yakh bin, ken litvak un, ken galitsyaner)
"I am a Polish Jew, not a Lithuanian or, God forbid, a Galician."

Nor do they mention the bleak prospect that running for re-election could mean spending millions of dollars and toughing out a difficult campaign, only to lose anyway.

(Ohio, Pryce, 56, Columbus, last year)
The intensity of that campaign left a mark on Ms. Pryce, who said she was turned off by the vitriol as well as the more than $4.5 million she had to raise and pour into her own attack ads. It was obscene the amount of money I had to spend, said Ms. Pryce, a former municipal court judge.

Musharraf Declares Emergency Rule - New York Times

ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Nov. 3  The Pakistani leader, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, declared a state of emergency on Saturday night, suspending the countrys Constitution, blacking out all independent television news reports and filling the streets of the capital with police officers and soldiers.
(ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Nov. 3, Pakistani, Pervez Musharraf, Saturday, night, the countrys Constitution)
The move appeared to be an effort by General Musharraf to reassert his fading power in the face of growing opposition from the countrys Supreme Court, civilian political parties and hard-line Islamists.

Pakistans Supreme Court was expected to rule within days on the legality of General Musharrafs re-election last month as the countrys president, which opposition groups have said was improper.

The justices were ordered to sign a provisional constitutional order enabling the emergency decree, according to Western diplomats, with the government leaving implicit that any justices failing to do so would be dismissed.

Pakistani government officials said Friday that emergency rule could be justified because of clashes in the past week between security forces and Islamic militants in the Swat Valley, in the North-West Frontier Province, and because of the increasing number of suicide attacks against military and police installations.

As of 9 p.m., Chief Justice Chaudhry and the other justices had gone to their homes, surrounded by police and with the phone lines cut, witnesses and officials said.
(9 p.m., Chaudhry)
Analysts said the emergency-rule decree in effect was the declaring of martial law, because there were no constitutional provisions allowing for such an order. This is the imposition of real military rule, because there is no Constitution and Pakistan is being run under provisional constitutional order issued by Musharraf as the army chief, not as the president of Pakistan, said Hasan Askari Rizvi, an expert on Pakistani military affairs.
(Constitution, Pakistan, Musharraf, Hasan Askari Rizvi, Pakistani)
General Musharraf resorted to military power to gain the presidency in October 1999 when he staged a bloodless coup, and Mr. Rizvi said this was a return to those measures. This is the first time Musharraf has brought in military rule to sustain himself in power, he said. He felt threatened by the Supreme Court.
(Musharraf, October 1999, Rizvi, first, Musharraf, the Supreme Court.)
Mr. Chaudhry has been the focal point of the opposition to General Musharraf since the president fired him from the post last Boosted by support from lawyers, judges and a wide public following, Mr. Chaudhry led a street-style political campaign against his summary firing that helped fuel the growing popular sentiment against General Musharraf.
(Chaudhry, General Musharraf, Chaudhry, General Musharraf)
The Supreme Court reinstated Mr. Chaudhry this summer, and in September the Supreme Court ruled in favor of General Musharraf, saying he could run for re-election while still in uniform.

Takeover - New Arts Audiences - New York Times
()
For a certain, dwindling generation of art-loving Manhattanites, a mental map of Brooklyn resembles a variation on Saul Steinbergs Big Apple-centric New Yorker cover, with the borough an undifferentiated lump save for that citadel of culture, the Brooklyn Academy of Music.
(Manhattanites, Brooklyn, New Yorker, the Brooklyn Academy of Music)
Witness the BAMbus, which exists, much to the eye-rolling of locals, to zip Brooklyn-leery audiences to and from a show as painlessly as possible.
(BAMbus, Brooklyn)
Those buses and the audience they serve were nowhere in sight on Saturday night.
(Saturday, night)
But the academy was pulsating, as around 3,000 people, seemingly all in their 20s and 30s, jammed in for the first Takeover.
(around 3,000, 20s and 30s)
From the omnipresent plastic cups, containing $3 beers, to the raucous bands occupying the main stage, the event, from 9 p.m. to 4 a.m., resembled an extravagant frat party.
(3, 9 p.m. to 4 a.m.)
Or, as an academy employee said, Its like my days at Galapagos, the performance space in Williamsburg, only without the drugs.
()
The academys executive producer Joseph V. Melillo, looking somewhat overwhelmed amid a sea of hipsters, said, We lost our virginity tonight.
(Joseph V. Melillo, We)
The brainchild of younger staff members in the marketing department, Takeover also included art installations, D.J.s and a Lindsay Lohan midcareer retrospective at BAMcinématek, all for $15.
(Takeover, BAMcinématek, 15)
It has been variously interpreted as a gimmicky promotional ploy and an exciting attempt to make the academy a more dynamic cultural center, and it comes at a time when its Brooklyn audience, according to internal figures, is fast overtaking its Manhattan one.
(Brooklyn, Manhattan)
The highly coveted demographic of younger artgoers, many of whom could be seen at Takeover flitting from one activity to the next, tends to be culturally omnivorous and often disinclined to sit quietly in a dark theater for several hours.
(one, several hours)
A reporters informal survey found that many at Takeover had been to the Brooklyn Academy only rarely or never, though several said they would now return.
(reporters, the Brooklyn Academy)
Lisa Mallory, the academys vice president for marketing and communications, described its stages as imposing. Transforming a space, taking it over, she said. Its very empowering.

She pointed to the popularity of a subscription package available for the Next Wave festival called Short Attention Span Sampler, in which all the works are 90 minutes or less. Im not sure what that means, whether its a good thing or not, but its a reality that arts institutions must be thinking about.

(Carla Peterson, Stephen Greco, Chelseas)
Buildings trap as well as enable, Mr. Greco said. We want to make this building as permeable as possible for outside and inside forces.
(Greco,)
Such efforts are an acknowledgment of the tensions between art and the structures  architectural and administrative  built to support it.
()
These tensions grow with time and financial success, as boards and administrations become more conservative and programs become static.
()
Theres an if it aint broke dont fix it attitude among arts organizations, said Guy Yarden, Danspace Projects interim executive director, who has worked at Dance Theater Workshop, Movement Research and Performance Space 122. Theyre encouraging artists to be innovative, but theyre not challenging themselves to be innovative in their own practices.

Eventful 15-Day Mission for Shuttle Discovery Ends
(15-Day Mission for Shuttle, Discovery)
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., Nov. 7  The shuttle Discovery glided to a safe landing here Wednesday, bringing to a close an eventful mission that combined challenging space station construction and emergency repairs.
(CANAVERAL, Fla., Nov. 7, Discovery, Wednesday)
The shuttle flew over North America from the northwest to the southeast and touched down on the 15,000-foot landing strip at the Kennedy Space Center shortly after 1 p.m.
(North America, 15,000-foot, the Kennedy Space Center, shortly after 1 p.m.)
It could be seen passing high above the landing site as a speedy white dot, its distinctive double sonic ba-BOOM sounding moments after it passed overhead, having traveled more than 6.2 million miles since it roared off the launching pad on Oct. 23.
(more than 6.2 million miles, Oct. 23)
The mission started out as a pivotal moment in construction of the International Space Station, tightly packed with goals that included delivering a new room  the Harmony module  and relocating an enormous solar array and truss from its temporary position atop the station to its permanent location on the left side.
(the International Space Station, Harmony)
Along with those spacewalks and one to prepare the Harmonys external fittings, the mission also called for a fourth spacewalk in which astronauts would test repair techniques for the shuttles delicate thermal tiles, and a fifth to begin preparing the station for the December visit of the shuttle Atlantis.
(Harmonys, fourth, fifth, December, Atlantis)
The first three spacewalks went smoothly, and the truss was moved successfully.
(first, three)
But two problems caused mission managers to change their plans for the remainder of the mission.
(two,)
The first was a problem with a rotary joint that keeps the right-side arrays facing the sun.
(first,)
Engineers had noticed that the joint was vibrating oddly and using too much power; during the second spacewalk, on Oct. 28, Daniel M. Tani removed a cover from the joint and found that it was fouled with metal shavings, suggesting that some part of the joint was grinding itself down.
(second, Oct. 28, Daniel M. Tani)
The joint will be repaired next year.
(next year,)
Then on Oct. 30, as astronauts inside the station opened the newly relocated solar array, a guide wire snagged on one of the folding panels hinges and tore two holes in a 110-foot-long wing of the array.
(Oct. 30, one, panels, two, 110-foot-long)
Plans for the remaining spacewalks were shelved to take on a high-stakes, high-risk effort to repair the torn array.
()
On Saturday, Scott E. Parazynski rode the station robotic arm, extended with a sensor boom from the shuttle, to reach the array, snip the errant wires and apply five cufflinks that took the strain off of the material around the tears and allowed the damaged array to be fully extended.
(Saturday, Scott E. Parazynski)
The shuttles seven astronauts were Pamela A. Melroy, the commander, who is a retired colonel in the Air Force; the pilot, Col. George D. Zamka of the Marine Corps; Dr. Parazynski; Stephanie D. Wilson; Col. Douglas H. Wheelock of the Army; Paolo A. Nespoli, an Italian representing the European Space Agency; and Mr. Tani, who flew up with the crew and remained aboard the station.
(seven, Pamela A. Melroy, the Air Force, George D. Zamka, the Marine Corps, Parazynski, Stephanie D. Wilson, Douglas H. Wheelock, Army, Paolo A. Nespoli, Italian, the European Space Agency, Tani)
The shuttle brought Clayton C. Anderson back to Earth on his 15th wedding anniversary; he had lived and worked aboard the station since June.
(Clayton C. Anderson, Earth, 15th, June)
In interviews from space on Tuesday, Mr. Anderson said he expected that readjustment to gravity might be a little rough.
(Tuesday, Anderson)
In an evening news conference, Ms. Melroy said the mission felt like hitting a triple home run with its dual construction tasks and the round-the-clock effort to come up with a fix for the solar array. What you saw is who we are at NASA, she said.
(Melroy,)
The end of this mission sets off a scramble aboard the space station to prepare for the next shuttle visit, with three spacewalks planned by the three-member station crew so that the orbiting outpost would be ready for a new laboratory module, known as Columbus, that will be brought up by the Atlantis on a mission that may begin as early as Dec. 6.
(three, three, Columbus, Atlantis, Dec. 6)
In a news conference after the landing, NASAs administrator, Michael Griffin, said it was hard for most people to appreciate the difficulty and the accomplishments of the work going on in orbit far above their heads.
(Michael Griffin,)
I think  and I dont say this lightly  I think that building the space station is far more difficult and certainly far more complex than was executing Apollo, Mr. Griffin said. Whats happening here is extraordinary.
(I, , Griffin)
And its way beyond anything that has ever been done by human beings before, anywhere.
()
Difficulties like the solar array problem are to be expected, he said, but cant be predicted.

Sentence of Life Without Parole in Killing of Officer
(Killing,)
A Brooklyn man who was convicted of fatally shooting a police officer in a wild car chase through Flatbush two years ago was sentenced today to life in prison without the chance of parole.
(Brooklyn, Flatbush, two years ago, today)
The man, Allan Cameron, 29, insisted on his innocence before the sentence was handed down, saying in remarks to the courtroom and to Justice Albert Tomei of State Supreme Court that prosecutors had charged the wrong man
(Allan Cameron, 29, Albert Tomei, State Supreme Court)
The only thing Im guilty of today, your honor, is being young, black, and poor, he said.
(today,)
Mr. Cameron spoke before a courtroom that was filled past its capacity of 164 occupants, with the family of the slain officer, Dillon Stewart, 35, and throngs of police officers in their dress blue uniforms looking on.
(Cameron, 164, Dillon Stewart, 35)
Officer Stewarts sister, Sheryl Campbell-Julian, also addressed the courtroom during a victim impact statement in which she remembered the night that her brother was killed.
(Sheryl Campbell-Julian,)
I dreamt that the skies opened up and out came a beam of light, she said. And through that beam of light, the voice of my brother saying I love you.
(I,)
She and other family members, including Officer Stewarts wife, Leslyn Stewart, asked the judge for the maximum sentence of life without parole.
(Leslyn Stewart,)
But his defense lawyers argued that the shooting was neither premeditated nor for financial gain, and said that he was not the worst of the worst. They asked for a smaller penalty along the lines of 25 years to life.
(25 years,)
Speaking about the possibility of Mr. Cameron receiving the maximum penalty, Ed Friedman, one of his defense lawyers, said that it would not be prudent.
(Cameron, Ed Friedman, one)
You cant kill his body, he said. But if you give him life without parole, you are going to kill his soul.
()
Justice Tomei said that he sentenced Mr. Cameron to the maximum penalty in part because he showed no remorse.
(Tomei, Cameron)
The murder of Officer Stewart in the early hours of Nov. 28., 2005, was a case that stirred outrage from the very beginning.
(Officer Stewart, the early hours of Nov. 28, 2005)
On that night, Officer Stewart was on patrol outside a nightclub in an unmarked car when he saw a red Infiniti run a stoplight.
(that night, Stewart, Infiniti)
He gave chase, pulled alongside the car and ordered the driver to stop.
()
According to investigators, the driver of that vehicle fired six shots, striking Officer Stewart once through the armpit, just above a panel of his bullet-resistant vest.
(six, Stewart)
The bullet lodged in his heart, and he died later that morning.
(later that morning,)
During the trial, prosecutors painted a picture of a brave officer who kept up the pursuit even in his final seconds.
(his final seconds,)
Although mortally wounded with a bullet in his heart, they said, Officer Stewart  joined by other officers  followed the Infiniti to a parking garage, where it escaped behind a closing door.
(Stewart, Infiniti)
Locating a previous owner of the car, investigators obtained Mr. Camerons name, tracked his cellphone records, found him in the apartment of a girlfriend and arrested him.
(Camerons,)
He was charged with first-degree murder and several other crimes.
()
Prosecutors argued during the trial that Mr. Cameron had plenty of motivation to evade the police and shoot at Officer Stewart.
(Cameron, Stewart)
As Mr. Cameron ran the stoplight that night, he was carrying more than 50 small bags of marijuana and a 9-millimeter handgun, they said.
(Cameron, more than 50, marijuana, 9)
He was also on probation for running from the police, wanted on charges that he had assaulted police officers in Philadelphia and suspected of robbing an off-duty officer in Brooklyn.
(Philadelphia, Brooklyn)
The case eventually led the city to spend $12 million on new bullet-resistant vests that would provide more coverage of the neck and the sides of the torso.
($12 million,)
In Albany, lawmakers passed new laws increasing the penalties for weapons possession and crimes against police officers.

C.E.O. Evolution Phase 3 - New York Times
()
Has the time come for C.E.O. Version 3.0?
(C.E.O. Version,)
The first iteration made its mark in the 1990s, as chief executives like Sanford I. Weill, Gerald M. Levin, John F. Welch Jr. and Michael Eisner built empires, not to mention their profiles, at the companies they ran: Citigroup, Time Warner, GE and Disney.
(first, the 1990s, Sanford I. Weill, Gerald M. Levin, John F. Welch Jr., Michael Eisner, Time Warner, GE, Disney)
When the shares deflated earlier this decade after the burst of the tech bubble and various corporate scandals, a new cadre moved in: the Fix-it Men.
(earlier this decade,)
They were lower-key leaders like Charles O. Prince III of Citigroup and Richard D. Parsons of Time Warner, whose job it was to repair the excesses and mistakes of their predecessors.
(Charles O. Prince III, Citigroup, Richard D. Parsons, Time Warner)
Now, management experts and longtime watchers of corporate America say the current environment demands, and is attracting, yet another kind of chief executive: the team builder.
(America,)
Its someone who can assemble a team that functions as smoothly as a jazz sextet, said Warren Bennis, a professor of management at the University of Southern California and author of many books on leadership.
(sextet,, Warren Bennis, the University of Southern California)
In the last week, Mr. Prince and Mr. Parsons both announced they would be stepping aside.
(the last week, Prince, Parsons)
Mr. Princes abrupt exit followed huge losses that dragged down Citigroups long-stagnant stock, while Mr. Parsons is retiring at the end of 2007 after a five-year tenure, during which he stabilized the company but failed to move Time Warner shares higher.
(Princes, Citigroups, Parsons, the end of 2007, five-year, Time Warner)
A third chief executive, E. Stanley ONeal of Merrill Lynch, was forced out late last month after his firm announced an $8.4 billion write-down.
(third, E. Stanley, Merrill Lynch, late last month, $8.4 billion)
Mr. ONeal substantially increased Merrills revenue and profit during his tenure but has been criticized for forcing out subordinates he perceived as rivals, while several top executives left Citigroup during Mr. Princes reign.
(ONeal, Merrills, Citigroup, Princes)
Now both companies find themselves searching for permanent replacements.
()
Theyve got to have not just the cognitive ability to run a major firm, which Stan ONeal definitely had, but the ability to make people feel like theyre working together, Mr. Bennis said.
(Stan ONeal, Bennis)
Merrill and Citi might consider looking at chief executives like A.G. Lafley of Procter & Gamble or W. James McNerney Jr. of Boeing as archetypes of the new model, according to Mr. Bennis.
(Merrill, Citi, A.G. Lafley, Procter & Gamble, W. James McNerney Jr., Boeing, Bennis)
Both felt the need to make sure the top hundred people know that theyre in this together, that their fates are correlated, Mr. Bennis says. Thats what it will take to succeed in this century.
(hundred, Bennis)
Mr. Lafley and Mr. McNerney have won plaudits not merely for their personal style, but also for their bottom-line performance, with shares of Procter & Gamble and Boeing easily outpacing the likes of Citigroup and Time Warner, as well as the benchmark Standard & Poors 500-stock index, over the last two years.
(Lafley, McNerney, Procter & Gamble, Boeing, Citigroup, Time Warner, Standard & Poors, 500, the last two years)
Thats no coincidence, according to Michael Useem, a professor of management at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and director of the Center for Leadership and Change Management there. The academic research says if you want to predict what the future financial performance over the next one to three years will be, you need to know the top team, he said.
(Michael Useem, the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, the Center for Leadership and Change Management, the next one to three years, team,)
Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for executive programs at the School of Management at Yale, says the style of todays best chief executives differs from both the empire builders and the cleanup specialists.
(Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld, the School of Management at Yale)
The former were known for public swagger and boardroom-size egos, while the latter often excelled at a narrow set of skills, Mr. Sonnenfeld said.
(Sonnenfeld,)
He cited Mr. Princes skills as a lawyer who was able to get his company back into the good graces of regulators after Mr. Weills departure.
(Princes, Weills)
Others say Mr. Parsons was a strong administrator, but failed to offer a strategy that satisfied Wall Street.
(Parsons,)
Mr. Sonnenfeld says Mr. Lafley and Mr. McNerney, along with Anne Mulcahy, chief executive of Xerox, possess the vision of the empire builders without their overpowering egos, while also bringing more personal warmth to the corner office
(Sonnenfeld, Lafley, McNerney, Anne Mulcahy, Xerox)
Ms. Mulcahy, for example, was able to cut jobs and restore Xeroxs profitability without coming across as mean-spirited, Mr. Sonnenfeld said.
(Mulcahy, Sonnenfeld)
Mr. Lafley is disarmingly unpretentious, he added. He never comes to my summits and Ive never been a consultant for him, but he towers over other C.E.O.s when it comes to putting in people stronger than himself or his ability to talk about setbacks.
(Lafley,)
Mr. Lafley has spent his entire career at Procter & Gamble, while Mr. McNerney arrived at Boeing after decades at General Electric, long regarded as something of a management boot camp, and after a successful stint as chief executive of 3M.
(Lafley, Procter & Gamble, McNerney, Boeing, decades, General Electric)
Although clearly an outsider at Boeing, Mr. Sonnenfeld said, he learned to listen to the culture there.
(Boeing, Sonnenfeld)
This approach, he said, means these leaders were able to introduce change but people dont hate them for it; the team comes to them.
()
Mr. ONeal, on the other hand, fired people who shouldnt have been fired, Mr. Bennis said.
(ONeal, Bennis)
Mr. Prince, he added, was always in the shadow of Mr. Weill; he never was able to build his own team.
(Prince, Weill)
And when disaster struck in the form of billions in losses from the subprime meltdown, these weaknesses came back to haunt Citigroup and Merrill Lynch.
(billions, Citigroup, Merrill Lynch)
Whenever you have such a stunning decline, errors become much more visible, Mr. Bennis said.
(Bennis,)
Of course, just as chief executives shape the times, so do the times shape them. Theres a theory that the people who get to the top at big companies should be best at solving the problems of their era, Mr. Useem said.
(Useem,)
In fact, Mr. Sonnenfeld said, the original archetype was what he called the custodian, leaders who came of age during the Organization Man era of the 1950s, but were overwhelmed by the rapidly shifting economic landscape of the 1970s and 1980s.
(Sonnenfeld, Organization Man era of the 1950s, the 1970s and 1980s)
They were followed by the empire builders who focused on mega-mergers and financial management in the 1990s to deliver the growth Wall Street demanded while getting big enough to achieve economies of scale and beat back foreign competitors.
(the 1990s,)
The cleanup artists arrived on the scene in the wake of the collapse of Enron and WorldCom and the passage of Sarbanes-Oxley legislation, which tightened government oversight of public companies.
(Enron, WorldCom, Sarbanes-Oxley)
At the same time, investors were demanding quick fixes.
()
In Time Warners case, Carl C. Icahn, the billionaire activist investor, pressed for a quick breakup of the company, something Mr. Parsons was able to stave off.
(Time Warners, Carl C. Icahn, Parsons)
Business schools are also opting for the 3.0 approach.
(3.0,)
At the Yale School of Management last year, Mr. Sonnenfeld said, the dean and faculty threw out the old first-year curriculum that emphasized individual disciplines like finance and marketing and replaced it with a team-oriented approach, with professors teaching these subjects jointly.

In addition, he said, We have students, faculty and staff assemble their own teams as part of their training to be future execs.

What will be the main challenge in the next 5 to 10 years?

Mr. Useem predicted it would be achieving double-digit growth internally, without the benefit of huge deals or accounting sleight-of-hand. Thats why I think the baton will go to the manager who will stimulate a division and will be creative and innovative, he said.

Latin American Modernism, the Sequel
(Latin American, Modernism)
New York has been invigorated by a one-two punch of Latin American Modernism this season.
(New York, one-two, Latin American, this season)
The first blow was The Geometry of Hope: Latin American Abstract Art From the Patricia Phelps de Cisneros Collection, at the Grey Art Gallery at New York University.
(first, Latin American, the Grey Art Gallery, New York University)
That shows main drawback is that it will return home to Mrs. Cisneros in two weeks.
(Cisneros, two weeks)
Now the Museum of Modern Art is weighing in with a similarly long-titled exhibition whose 250-plus pieces are here to stay: New Perspectives in Latin American Art, 1930-2006: Selections From a Decade of Acquisitions.
(the Museum of Modern Art, 250, Latin American, 1930-2006, a Decade)
While the Grey Gallery show stops around 1970, this one takes the many-splendored history of Latin American modernism right up to the present, to exhilarating and enlightening effect.
(around 1970, Latin American)
It has been organized and sensitively installed by Luis Pérez-Oramas, who joined the Modern in 2003 and last year became its curator of Latin American art, the first curatorial position there to be designated by geography instead of art medium.
(Luis Pérez-Oramas, 2003, last year, Latin American, first)
While the Modern has been remiss in displaying the Latin American works in its collection, it is hardly a late arrival to the field.
(Modern, Latin American)
It focused primarily on Mexican art during the 1930s, but by 1941 it was systematically collecting art from across the region and was the first museum in the world to do so.
(Mexican, the 1930s, 1941, first)
Even Latin American museums tended to collect only national artists.
(Latin American,)
By 1943 MoMA was able to muster an exhibition (organized by Lincoln Kirstein) of around 270 Latin American works from its collection.
(1943, Lincoln Kirstein, 270, Latin American)
Today this collection is probably the largest and most comprehensive of its kind.
(Today,)
Acquisitions in this area dropped off in the 1970s and 80s, even as broadly international exhibitions like the 1971 Information had a strong Latin American representation.
(the 1970s, 80s, 1971, Latin American)
Still, MoMAs Latin American holdings now number more than 3,500.
(Latin American, more than 3,500)
The current exhibition has been selected from some 530 pieces added since 1996.
(some 530, 1996)
Until the late 1950s the museums acquisitions tended to favor figuration, whether Social Realist, Surrealist or Magic Realist.
(the late 1950s, Social Realist, Magic Realist)
The recent acquisitions  mostly purchases  reflect a process of both catch-up and course correction.
()
As in the Grey Gallery show, the latest additions emphasize abstract artists whose primary points of departure were Russian Constructivism and the more idealistic geometry of Mondrian.
(Russian, Mondrian)
The show begins with the work of Joaquín Torres-García, a colleague of Mondrian in Paris in the late 1920s whose return to Uruguay in 1934 helped spread the gospel of abstraction in Latin America.
(Joaquín Torres-García, Mondrian, Paris, the late 1920s, Uruguay, 1934, Latin America)
The styles that emerged there after World War II ran both parallel to and in opposition to developments in the United States, especially the scale of Abstract Expressionism and the material opulence of Minimalism.
(World War II, the United States, Minimalism)
But it intersected fruitfully with contemporary European developments like Group Zero and Arte Povera, played an essential role in Op Art and helped spawn a version of Conceptual Art that valued the collaborative, the implicitly political and the ephemeral.
(European, Group Zero, Arte Povera, Op Art, Conceptual Art)
This in turn set the stage for artists who have emerged since the mid-1980s, among them Ana Mendieta, Felix Gonzalez-Torres, Vik Muniz and Fernando Bryce.
(the mid-1980s, Ana Mendieta, Felix Gonzalez-Torres, Vik Muniz, Fernando Bryce)
The selection here covers quite a bit of this ground, with large clusters of works by several artists and lots of inter-generational back and forth, both intended and unconscious.
()
More than a dozen historic works from the late 40s, the 50s and the early 60s, about half of which are gifts from Mrs. Cisneros, lay out various concerns of Latin American art.
(More than a dozen, 40s, 50s, about half, Cisneros, Latin American)
Foremost is a conception of abstraction as unusually body oriented and actively engaged with either the optics of perception or the possibility of function.
()
These ideas crop up early in a beguiling gamelike sculpture from 1945 by Alejandro Xul Solar; it deconstructs the compartments of Torres-Garcías canvases into a series of painted blocks that look eminently touchable.
(Alejandro Xul Solar,)
A more austere hanging sculpture by Gyula Kosice made of hinged strips of brass (1948) may be the worlds earliest example of Arte Povera; its casualness echoes in adjustable sculptures by Lygia Clark and later on Mira Schendel, whose woven rice-paper piece from the mid-1960s is one of the exhibitions highlights.
(Gyula Kosice, 1948, Arte Povera, Lygia Clark, Mira Schendel, the mid-1960s, one)
The idea of adjustability continues with Hélio Oiticicas brightly colored box (which gains immeasurably from a higher pedestal than in previous appearances) and Cildo Meireless folding-rule sculptures from the early 70s.
(Hélio Oiticicas, Cildo Meireless)
Some works imaginatively cross-fertilize aesthetic approaches.
()
Black-and-white paintings and works on paper by Carmen Herrera, Willys de Castro and Hércules Barsotti split the difference between Op Art and more traditional geometric abstraction, which means they are dazzling without being dizzying.
(Carmen Herrera, Willys de Castro, Op Art)
Jesús Rafael Soto achieved a similar fusion of Op Art and assemblage, making brilliant use of things like driftwood and tangles of old wire in two works here.
(Rafael Soto, Op Art, two)
A related sensibility is at play in a sculpture from 1962 by Sérgio Camargo in which a chunk of driftwood is partly encrusted, as if by a crystal formation, with masses of small wood dowels painted white.
(1962, Sérgio Camargo)
The use of found material reaches opposing apotheoses in Ernesto Netos modest drawings (two use saffron) and Mr. Munizs large color photograph Narcissus, After Caravaggio (2005), which is the result of skillfully marshaling a pile of junk into an old-master image.
(Ernesto, two, Munizs, 2005)
And the emphasis on black and white abstraction is picked up, unexpectedly, in three small ink drawings by Gabriel Orozco.
(three, Gabriel Orozco)
This show repeatedly reminds us that art can be made out of almost nothing, and that strong color is a viable substitute for large size.
()
The point is made early on in a group of 10 resolutely abstract collages from 1950 by Alejandro Otero of Venezuela that simultaneously pursue the implications of Mondrians Broadway Boogie-Woogie and of Matisses cut-outs, and in the small, bright free-standing forms in gouache on cardboard of Lygia Papes marvelous Book of Creation from 1959-60.
(10, 1950, Alejandro Otero, Venezuela, Matisses, 1959-60)
Ms. Papes faith in color obviously echoes in Oiticicas work but also in Santiago Cucullus new prints, in which bright abstract swirls are punctuated by dark, sinister images redolent of the clandestine events that riddle so much of Latin Americas recent history.
(Oiticicas, Santiago Cucullus, Latin Americas)
Also relevant are Rivane Neuenschwanders colored-over newspaper comic strips.
(Rivane Neuenschwanders,)
These in turn echo Álvaro Barrioss earlier use of newspapers; in the mid-1970s he persuaded a Colombian daily to publish his pastels and collage images regularly.
(the mid-1970s, Colombian)
An obsession with fine lines, either organized or running free, is evident in drawings, prints and paintings on paper from the early 60s by Gego (Gertrude Goldschmidt) and by León Ferrari.
(Gertrude Goldschmidt, León Ferrari)
It can be followed through the show in Waltercio Caldass tiny printed-word drawings from the 1970s, a single extraordinary ink and pencil drawing by Eduardo Stupía from 1985 and, more recently, the drawings of the collective Assume Vivid Astro Focus (on acetate) and José Damasceno.
(Waltercio Caldass, the 1970s, Eduardo Stupía, 1985, José Damasceno)
Plenty of other conversations and cross-references contribute to the richness of this exhibition, as do largely excellent selections, including, on the recent end, works by Los Carpinteros, Eugenio Dittborn, Abelardo Morell, Alfredo Jaar and Arturo Herrera.
(Los Carpinteros, Eugenio Dittborn, Abelardo Morell, Alfredo Jaar, Arturo Herrera)
The implicit message throughout is that the house that classic Modernism built has always been more inclusive than previously thought, and is getting bigger all the time.

Plea Made for Patient Who Gouged Out His Eyes Bill for Care Called Retaliation for Suit
(Care Called Retaliation for Suit,)
By Keith L. Alexander Washington Post Staff Writer Thursday, August 30, 2007; B02
(Keith L. Alexander, Washington Post, Thursday, August 30, 2007, B02)
A D.C. Council member blasted government officials yesterday for trying to collect $2.2 million in medical bills from a mentally ill man who gouged out his eyes while he was a patient at St. Elizabeths Hospital.
(D.C. Council, yesterday, $2.2 million, St. Elizabeths Hospital)
Council member Phil Mendelson (D-At Large) said it was "outrageous, unfair and immoral" for the city to seek the money after the guardian for Frank Harris Jr. filed a lawsuit against the District in D.C. Superior Court.
(Council, Phil Mendelson, Frank Harris Jr., D.C. Superior Court)
The suit says the city was not properly supervising Harris when he used his hands to gouge out his eyes in March 2003 at the District-run psychiatric hospital.
(Harris, March 2003)
Mendelson accused the city of preparing the bill to discourage the guardian from pursuing the lawsuit.
(Mendelson,)
He joined the guardian, Janice Motley of Bowie, and her attorney, Joseph Cammarata, at a news conference yesterday outside the courthouse.
(Janice Motley, Bowie, Joseph Cammarata, yesterday)
"This bill is an attempt to punish Mrs. Motley and Frank Harris," Cammarata said.
(Motley, Frank Harris, Cammarata)
Harris, 55, who has schizophrenia, has been committed by court order to St. Elizabeths since 1973, after his arrest on burglary.
(Harris, 55, St. Elizabeths, 1973)
In court papers, Cammarata alleges that the hospital failed to stop Harris from harming himself despite a doctor's warning that he be kept under one-to-one supervision and in restraints.
(Cammarata, Harris)
Days before the incident, the court papers say, Harris spoke about demons that were telling him to pull out his eyes.
(Harris,)
But the hospital permitted Harris to temporarily be out of the restraints, Cammarata said.
(Harris, Cammarata)
Motley's suit was filed in October, seeking $10 million in damages.
(Motley, October, $10 million)
Three months later, District officials sent her a notice saying that she owed more than $2 million for Harris's room and board at St. Elizabeths from 1987 to 2005.
(Three months later, more than $2 million, Harris, St. Elizabeths, 1987 to 2005)
It was the first notice Motley said she had ever received since Harris was committed to the hospital and declared indigent.
(first, Motley, Harris)
Harris, who is now blind, remains a patient at the hospital.
(Harris,)
Motley has known Harris since he was a youth.
(Harris,)
Mendelson said the District's billing could cause others to avoid suing the city for fear of financial recourse.
(Mendelson,)
He has asked Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (D) to withdraw the bill, as has the council chairman, Vincent C. Gray (D).
(Mayor Adrian M. Fenty, Vincent C. Gray)
Details about the case were first reported by the Examiner.
(Examiner,)
George Valentine, the District's deputy attorney general for civil litigation, said the memo, which at the bottom reads, "payment in full is due upon receipt of this statement," was not a bill but instead a setoff that would go into effect only if a jury ruled in Harris's favor and awarded compensation.
(George Valentine, District, Harris)
If a jury failed to award financial compensation, Valentine said, Harris would not have to pay.
(Valentine, Harris)
Valentine said such policies are standard with the city.
(Valentine,)
Whenever patients who were once declared indigent get financial windfalls, they are required to pay for the care they received, he said.
()
Valentine said that Harris's estate could challenge the setoff and that the final bill would be determined by a judge.
(Valentine, Harris)
"To some people, it looks like we're trying to mitigate the process to counter a lawsuit, which we are not," Valentine said.
(Valentine,)
This has been a consistent policy.
()
In a letter yesterday responding to Gray and Mendelson, Fenty's general counsel, Peter Nickles, said requiring payment is "mandatory" under D.C. law.
(yesterday, Gray, Mendelson, Fenty, Peter Nickles, D.C.)
Mendelson said the city had a choice in seeking such payments.
(Mendelson,)
"They act like this law leaves them with no discretion," he said.
()
Mendelson has pointed out that Fenty sided with him and Gray on a similar case when Fenty was on the D.C. Council.
(Mendelson, Fenty, Fenty, the D.C. Council)
In 2002, Fenty, who at that time represented Ward 4, joined the other council members in writing a letter urging then-Mayor Anthony A. Williams (D) to refrain from filing liens against the estates of six mentally retarded patients who died under the city's care.
(2002, Fenty, Ward 4, Anthony A. Williams, six)
At that time, the government was being sued as part of a class-action case regarding the District's care.

The city never collected on the liens.

The Most Feared Man on the Hill?

For Gay Blogger, Craig's Resignation Is Just the Latest on His List
(Gay Blogger, Craig's Resignation Is Just the Latest on His List)
By Jose Antonio Vargas Washington Post Staff Writer Tuesday, September 4, 2007; C01
(Jose Antonio, Vargas, Washington Post, Tuesday, September 4, 2007)
Soon, a new name will pop up on Mike Rogers's hit list.
(Mike Rogers's,)
Larry Craig wasn't "the first on my list," the gay blogger says.
(Larry Craig, first)
And the Idaho senator, who announced his resignation Saturday, "won't be the last."
(Idaho, Saturday)
Rogers, sitting on a club chair in his Northwest Washington apartment, is basking in the attention.
()
For three years now, he's been a feared one-man machine, "outing," he says, nearly three dozen senior political and congressional staffers, White House aides and, most damagingly, Congress members on his blog.
(three years, one, nearly three dozen, White House, Congress)
On Capitol Hill, a typical phone call from Rogers -- "Are you gay?" he'd ask -- is "a call from Satan himself," says a former high-ranking congressional staffer whose name is on the list.
(Capitol Hill,)
Rogers reasons that there's justice behind his tactics -- "odious," "outrageous" and "over-the-line" as they might seem to his detractors.
()
In Rogers's mind, if you're against gay rights in your public life and you live a secret homosexual life, all bets are off.
()
In 2004, one of the first public officials he targeted was then-Virginia congressman Ed Schrock because of his voting record on such issues as gays in the military, same-sex marriage and gay adoption.
(2004, one, first, Virginia, Ed Schrock)
In 2000, for instance, Schrock told the Virginian-Pilot: "You're in the showers with them, you're in the bunk room with them, you're in staterooms with them."
(2000, Schrock)
Schrock decided not to run for reelection because of the rumors.
()
In 2005, Rogers blogged about Mark Foley, months before his inappropriate instant-messages to male congressional pages became public and he was forced to resign.
(2005, Mark Foley, months)
The former Florida congressman had a varied record, sometimes voting in favor of gay rights, but at one point voting against adoption by same-sex couples.
(Florida, one)
And last October, he says, he targeted Craig -- months before an undercover sex sting in a Minneapolis airport men's room, and before the Idaho Statesman started its months-long investigation.
(last October, Craig, months, Minneapolis, the Idaho Statesman, months-long)
Two years earlier, Rogers notes, the three-term senator had voted for the failed constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage.
(Two years earlier, three)
"Hypocrisy," Rogers sneers, "plain, hate-filled hypocrisy."
(Hypocrisy,)
In the coming months, he plans to post the names of "a few more" closeted Congress members on his blog, he says, all of them Republicans.
(the coming months, Congress, Republicans)
There are 33 names on his published list, most of them men, 30 from the GOP.
(33, 30, GOP)
That fact reveals more about the Republicans, he says, than about him.
(Republicans,)
Although a registered Democrat, he says he is bipartisan.
(Democrat,)
"I write about closeted people whose records are anti-gay," he says.
()
If you're a closeted Democrat or Republican and you don't bash gays or vote against gay rights to gain political points, I won't out you.
(Democrat, Republican)
The Craig scandal has gripped the capital.
(Craig,)
For many gays, the episode harks back to times when closeted homosexuals were arrested in the city's cruising spots for "disorderly behavior."
()
For many people, gay and straight, parsing out the details -- toe-tapping, fingers under the partition -- has been incredibly intriguing, and sometimes awkward.
()
Out of that discomfort, so many jokes to make, some exacerbated by Craig himself.
(Craig,)
A new catchphrase was born: "I have a wide stance."
()
Rogers, still sitting on his club chair, laughs about that one.
()
He turns serious, takes a sip of soda and goes on a tirade: "We, as a society, are afraid of talking about two men having sex.
(two,)
Lesbian sex?
()
'That's hot!'
()
But gay male sex?
()
Well, nothing makes straight men more uncomfortable.
()
Look at the reaction from the right, the double standard. . . .
()
Take [David] Vitter, the senator who's on the D.C. madam's list. . . .
(D.C.,)
Where were the calls for his resignation? . . .
()
Yes, Craig pleaded guilty to a crime but that's not really the reason why they're throwing him under the bus.
(Craig,)
Here comes the other "h" word.
()
Not just "hypocrisy."
()
But "homophobic."
()
At 43, Rogers came out in his early 20s and has spent the bulk of his life working for gay organizations.
(43, early 20s)
A native of the New York metropolitan area, he's lived in the District for more than a decade.
(New York, more than a decade)
Although his blog isn't his main source of income -- he was a fundraising consultant and currently runs Page One News Media, a gay-oriented online company -- the Web site has become more than a full-time job.
()
He's a student of the gay rights movement and considers Larry Kramer, the writer and AIDS activist, and Franklin E. Kameny, the lifelong Washington firebrand, as models.
(Larry Kramer, Franklin E. Kameny, Washington)
"Mike's always been active, very involved, in the gay community," says Andy Humm, a reporter for Gay City News in New York and Rogers's friend of nearly 20 years.
(Mike, Andy Humm, Gay City News, New York, Rogers, nearly 20 years)
Like Kramer and Kameny, Rogers, some activists say, is fearless, aggressive, in-your-face.
(Kramer, Kameny)
But unlike them, he's got a blog, which since its inception has become a must-read among certain sets in Washington, especially its sizable gay population.
(Washington,)
The way Rogers tells it, his online activism began when the Republican-controlled Senate scheduled a vote against same-sex marriage in June 2004.
(Republican, Senate, June 2004)
The birth of the Internet has been a boon for gay socializing and organizing, and one of the first things Rogers did was post a profile on Gay.com, a popular site among gays.
(one, first, Gay.com)
The profile read: "If you're against the Federal Marriage Amendment and know someone who's closeted, send that information to me."
(the Federal Marriage Amendment,)
And while Hill groups such as the Gay, Lesbian &amp; Allies U.S. Senate Staff Caucus and the Lesbian and Gay Congressional Staff Association opposed his actions, word got around.
(Hill, Gay, Lesbian &, Allies U.S. Senate Staff, Caucus, the Lesbian and Gay Congressional Staff Association)
E-mails poured in, many anonymous.
()
He investigates his tips by working the phones; on rare occasions, he flies around the country to meet with sources.
()
Among his sources was a 40-year-old man who claimed to have had oral sex with Craig in a bathroom in Union Station.
(40-year-old, Craig, Union Station)
Rumors about some members of Congress have swirled for years, but for the most part, they've stayed just that: rumors.
(Congress, years)
There have been "outing scares" before, when a gay activist would write about this or that elected official.
()
But until Rogers and his blog came along, few people off the Hill knew of the rumors. .
(Rogers, Hill)
Says Kelly McBride, who teaches about ethics at the Poynter Institute, a journalism think tank: "In the past, when the mainstream media were the gatekeepers of information, you could scream all of you want -- 'A conservative senator from Idaho is gay!' -- and nobody would hear you.
(Kelly McBride, the Poynter Institute, Idaho)
But now people can hear anyone, and that's changed how mainstream media makes decisions about what to publish.
()
To some, Rogers is a hero, which is what BlogPac, a political action committee that funds progressive blogs, called him in July when presenting him with an award.
(BlogPac, July)
His supporters say he's been more effective than the established gay press and gay organizations in exposing the GOP's "image problem."
(GOP,)
"He's a sort of a muckraker, and he's sharing good information that other people don't," says Matt Stoller, the liberal blogger who heads BlogPac.
(Matt Stoller, BlogPac)
Critics, though, say he's a "pariah" who's hurting the gay community more than he's helping it.
()
To many of us, coming-out is a process, a very personal journey dictated by the individual.
()
My objection to outing is not about the people who are being outed.
()
It's about us," says Mark Agrast, a former top aide to former representative Gerry Studds, the Massachusetts Democrat who was the first openly gay member of Congress.
(Mark Agrast, Gerry Studds, Massachusetts, Democrat, first, Congress)
Agrast was one of the founding members of the Lesbian and Gay Congressional Staff Association.
(one, the Lesbian and Gay Congressional Staff Association)
"We don't have to admire the choices that Craig has made in his life," says Agrast, "to feel some compassion for a 62-year-old man who seeks anonymous encounters because he can't come to terms with who he is."
(Craig, Agrast, 62-year-old)
To some of the people on Rogers's list, such as former GOP official Dan Gurley, Rogers is "despicable."
(Rogers, GOP, Dan Gurley, Rogers)
Rogers blogged about Gurley, the former national field director at the Republican National Committee, in September 2004.
(Gurley, the Republican National Committee, September 2004)
Gurley, as Rogers tells it, had signed off on an RNC flier sent to conservative voting districts that shows one man proposing to another man.
(Gurley, Rogers, RNC, one)
The GOP wanted to scare voters.
(GOP,)
Look what will happen if the Democrats win!
(Democrats,)
Rogers says.
()
Gurley, however, says that he raised objections to the flier and that it wasn't his decision.
(Gurley,)
What was I supposed to do?
()
Gurley says in an interview.
(Gurley,)
He adds: "Who does Rogers think he is?
()
God?
()
What gives him the right to bully people around and tell us what to think or how to conduct our lives?
()
When Rogers posted Gurley's Gay.com profile on his blog, the GOP fired Gurley, who's left Washington and lives in North Carolina.
(Gurley, Gay.com, GOP, Gurley, Washington, North Carolina)
Rogers is sitting on his apartment's balcony, feet stretched out, still sipping soda.
()
It's been a very busy week.
(a very busy week,)
He's been on CNN, the "Today" show, National Public Radio.
(CNN, Today, National Public Radio)
Repeatedly he gets asked whether he feels vindicated.
()
The answer's always yes.
()
So does he have any secrets?
()
Don't we all?
()
Has he ever had sex in a public bathroom?
()
How is that relevant?
()
Look, I'm not a politician making laws and rules and regulations for 275 million people.
(275 million,)
You know what happens when you're in the U.S. military and you're brought up on charges of being gay or lesbian?
(U.S.,)
Your life is ruined.
()
You're at risk for death, for physical violence.
()
And there's Craig . . . who was chairman and was the ranking member of the Veterans Affairs Committee, not allowing gays to serve in the military?
(Craig, the Veterans Affairs Committee)
A little volume titled "The Book of Questions: Business, Politics and Ethics" is tucked under his coffee table.
("The Book of Questions: Business, Politics and Ethics,)
There, on Page 193, is the question: "How much right do we have to know about the private lives of elected officials?"
(193,)
Rogers says, "When those private lives are in direct conflict with the public policy that these officials espouse, I think it's fair game that their private lives be brought into this.
()
And I have to blog to do that with.
()
Here's the question: What community is expected to protect its own enemies?
()
Don't beat up the gay community, and then expect us to protect your secrets and your double life.

It's just not right.

Defense Department's Union Rules Challenged
(Defense Department's, Union Rules Challenged)
By Stephen Barr Thursday, October 25, 2007; D04
(Stephen Barr, Thursday, October 25, 2007, D04)
Three House Democrats are urging colleagues to revoke key parts of new personnel rules that would curb union rights at the Defense Department, contending the rules are a "bad deal" for Defense civil service employees.
(Three, House, Democrats, the Defense Department)
"We have heard from our constituents and other DOD civilian workers across the country that the system is taking its toll on the morale of this loyal workforce," Reps. Tom Allen (D-Maine), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) and Jay Inslee (D-Wash.) wrote.
(Tom Allen, D-Maine, Chris Van Hollen, Jay Inslee)
The three are asking fellow House members to sign a letter calling on House and Senate negotiators to include provisions in the fiscal 2008 defense authorization bill that would repeal parts of the new National Security Personnel System, known as NSPS.
(three, House, House, Senate, the fiscal 2008, National Security Personnel System)
The new personnel system permits the Pentagon to sharply curb union rights and to require employees to appeal major disciplinary actions to agency officials before they can gain access to an independent board and to the courts.
(Pentagon,)
The Pentagon has not moved to implement those changes, in part because of a lawsuit filed by a coalition of unions and because officials are waiting to see whether Congress, with Democrats in control, will block the modifications.
(Pentagon, Congress, Democrats)
Congress in 2003 granted authority to the secretary of defense to overhaul the pay and personnel rules for Defense civilians after the Bush administration complained that the regular civil service system was outdated and too cumbersome to allow rapid response to global events.
(Congress, 2003, Bush)
Officials said they wanted a system that would make it easier for managers to reward their best workers and to deal more effectively with employees performing at unsatisfactory or unacceptable levels.
()
But a coalition of 36 labor organizations, including the American Federation of Government Employees, the National Federation of Federal Employees, the Metal Trades Department, the AFL-CIO and the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, have lobbied against rules that would curtail their bargaining rights.
(36, the American Federation of Government Employees, the National Federation of Federal Employees, the Metal Trades Department, the AFL-CIO, the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers)
The unions contend the rules would limit workplace issues that could be put on the table for negotiations, allow the defense secretary to break contracts normally considered binding and stop them from taking labor-management disputes to independent third parties for review.
(third,)
Because changes in pay practices have not been challenged by unions, the Pentagon has been phasing in a new pay-for-performance system.
(Pentagon,)
By January, it will cover about 130,000 non-unionized Defense civilians.
(January, about 130,000, Defense)
If completed as planned, up to 700,000 employees would convert to the NSPS, with most leaving two government-wide systems, the General Schedule, which mostly applies to white-collar employees, and the Federal Wage System, which covers blue-collar government workers.
(up to 700,000, NSPS, two, the Federal Wage System)
In their letter, Allen, Van Hollen and Inslee assert that Pentagon leaders "went far beyond the authority granted by Congress" in creating the NSPS, which they argue "needlessly eviscerates the rights of the DOD workforce."
(Allen, Van Hollen, Inslee, Pentagon, Congress)
The three urged their colleagues to express support for including provisions in the fiscal 2008 defense authorization bill that would restore full collective bargaining rights to unions, return Defense civilians to the disciplinary appeals process used by most other government workers, exempt blue-collar workers from the NSPS and exempt employees at Defense science and research labs from the NSPS.

Court Reschedules Musharraf Case, Fearing Crisis
(Reschedules Musharraf Case,)
By Griff Witte and Imtiaz Ali Washington Post Foreign Service Friday, November 2, 2007; 8:32 AM
(Griff Witte, Imtiaz Ali, Post Foreign Service, Friday, November 2, 2007, 8:32 AM)
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Nov. 2 -- Pakistan's Supreme Court reversed course today and announced it would on Monday resume hearings on the validity of President Pervez Musharraf's reelection, saying it did not want uncertainty about the court's action to contribute to the mood of crisis in the country.
(ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Nov. 2, Pakistan, Supreme Court, today, Monday, Pervez Musharraf's)
The court had planned to delay further hearings on a challenge of Musharraf's reelection until Nov. 12, three days before his current term expires.
(Musharraf, Nov. 12, three days)
The delay, amid rising militancy in northwest Pakistan and the turbulent return from exile of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, fueled speculation that Musharraf was preparing to impose emergency rule to ensure his hold on power.
(Pakistan, Benazir Bhutto, Musharraf)
But "the court will not take any blame for the controversy being created," said Justice Javed Iqbal, head of a judicial panel reviewing whether Musharraf should have been allowed to run for a new term while he remained chief of the army.
(Javed Iqbal, Musharraf)
Iqbal, in announcing the resumption of hearings, said the court would try "to conclude the case in the shortest possible time," though he offered no specific date for a ruling, the Reuters wire service reported.
(Iqbal, Reuters)
At the same time, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice cautioned anew that the United States would oppose any effort by their ally Musharraf to impose emergency rule or postpone parliamentary elections planned for early next year.
(State, Condoleezza Rice, the United States, Musharraf, early next year)
The Bush administration has been "very clear that the important steps that have to be taken in Pakistan . . . first of all, Pakistan needs to be prepared by moderate forces beginning to work together," Rice said on a plane en route to meetings in Turkey.
(Bush, Pakistan, first, Pakistan, Rice, Turkey)
Asked whether she or President Bush had advised Musharraf against a martial law declaration, Rice said she would not supply details of any conversations.
(Bush, Musharraf, Rice)
"But I think it would be quite obvious that the United States wouldn't be supportive of extra-constitutional means," she said.
(the United States,)
As the debate over Musharraf's future continued in the capital, Pakistani forces fought pitched battles with insurgents Thursday in a scenic northwestern valley, leaving dozens dead.
(Musharraf, Pakistani, Thursday, dozens)
The surging violence and the uncertainty surrounding Musharraf's futurerevived speculation that he will declare a state of emergency, allowing him to postpone planned parliamentary elections.

They were soon surrounded by our fighters, and now they are under our control," said Maulana Siraj Uddin, the spokesman.

The deadliest strike came in the southern port city of Karachi last month when at least one suicide bomber detonated his explosives in a crowd of supporters cheering Bhutto.

Those rumors persisted Thursday and seemed to gain momentum after the Supreme Court indicated it would delay until mid-November the decision on whether Musharraf is eligible for a new term.
(Thursday, the Supreme Court, mid-November, Musharraf)
Opponents say his job as army chief should have disqualified him.

Though the court is now resuming deliberations on Monday, there is still no guarantee of a decision until near the end of his Nov. 15 term.

A Western diplomat said that he expected the court would ultimately side with the general but that if it didn't, "all bets are off as to how Musharraf conducts himself."

With Strong Debate, Clinton Quiets Talk of a Slide Spotlight Moves to Whether Rivals Can Slow Her Momentum Toward Nomination

LAS VEGAS, Nov. 16 -- Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton's strong performance in Thursday's Democratic debate here will blunt talk that she is on a downward slide and shift the focus to whether Sen. Barack Obama or former senator John Edwards can stop her march to the nomination, party strategists said Friday.
(LAS VEGAS, Nov. 16, Hillary Rodham Clinton's, Thursday, Democratic, Barack Obama, John Edwards, Friday)
"In some ways the hiccup of two weeks ago, or the misstep of two weeks ago, was good for the Clinton campaign, in that it brought the Clinton campaign back to earth and back to reality," said Democratic pollster Geoffrey Garin, referring to her rocky outing in a debate in Philadelphia late last month.
(two weeks ago, two weeks ago, Clinton, Clinton, Democratic, Geoffrey Garin, Philadelphia, late last month)
It was a campaign that probably started looking to the general election a little too early, that didn't take the voters' questions about Hillary Clinton to heart enough.
(Hillary Clinton,)
Steve Elmendorf, who ran the presidential campaign in 2004 for then-Rep.

Richard A. Gephardt, said Clinton's aggressiveness Thursday was a reminder to her rivals that she would not allow them to attack her indefinitely without responding.
(Richard A. Gephardt, Clinton, Thursday)
"She sent a very strong signal to the other candidates that there are no free shots here," he said.
()
She is ahead, and if they attack her, she'll hit back.
()
Everybody has vulnerabilities.
()
Clinton (N.Y.) won the battle of Las Vegas by aggressively turning the tables on her rivals, challenging them where they are vulnerable and forcing them to answer questions they weren't ready to answer.
(Clinton, N.Y., Las Vegas)
She once again demonstrated her skill as a debater -- and Obama (Ill.) showed that he is not as strong in debates as he is in other forums.
(Obama, Ill.)
The reactions from inside the Clinton and Obama campaigns signaled that between now and Iowa, there will be an intensifying debate over who should lead the party.
(Clinton, Obama, between now and Iowa)
Clinton advisers were ecstatic about the performance, which they felt successfully shifted the story line away from the candidate's earlier problems.
(Clinton,)
Gone was talk about "piling on," which had marked their response to the Philadelphia debate, even though her rivals were as critical of her Thursday night as they had been earlier.
(Philadelphia, Thursday, night)
"She gave a commanding performance," said Howard Wolfson, the campaign's communications director.
(Howard Wolfson,)
I think this was the most important debate since the first one, and it was important for her to be dominating, and she was.
(first,)
Robert Gibbs, Obama's communications director, disputed the high marks given to Clinton.
(Robert Gibbs, Clinton)
"I think the questions and the narratives that surrounded the candidates going into this debate are mostly present going out of this debate," he said.
()
I think you could see this in a number of answers.
()
I don't think she made any progress on providing clear or consistent answers to a number of questions she was asked last night.
(last night,)
Advisers to Edwards (N.C.) discounted reviews of their candidate's performance and said he continues to be a force, especially because of his strength in Iowa.
(Edwards, N.C., Iowa)
"Now more than ever it is clear that voters have a real choice in this election between John Edwards's bold vision of real change and Senator Clinton's flagging defense of the status quo and a broken system," said Chris Kofinis, communications director for Edwards.
(John Edwards's, Clinton, Chris Kofinis, Edwards)
Anita Dunn, a Democratic strategist who is neutral in the race, said she thinks the debate had two effects: to heighten the importance of a December debate in Iowa and to give a sense of a race that is narrowing to a contest between Clinton and Obama.
(Anita Dunn, Democratic, two, December, Iowa, Clinton, Obama)
"Edwards seems to defy gravity" in Iowa, she said.
(Iowa,)
He's always had a group of people there who just really like him, but this debate kind of set out the fault lines between the front-runners for those Iowa debates, which are [always] incredibly important but even more so now.
(Iowa,)
Garin described the race as a contest between old and new, with Obama finally making his case as effectively as Clinton has been making hers.
(Garin, Obama, Clinton)
"Obama has gotten much better and much sharper in framing that choice for voters over the course of the last four weeks," he said.
(the last four weeks,)
There's a lot more clarity and sharpness in the way he is defining the choice between new and old for voters and saying why it matters in a way that qualifies him more to be president.
()
But Clinton has been equally adept, he said, at leveraging her two principal strengths: her experience and the perception of Democratic voters that she cares about them and about policies that would make their lives better.
(Clinton, two, Democratic)
Obama showed again Thursday that debates are not his best forum.
(Thursday,)
He excelled on stage at last Saturday's Jefferson-Jackson dinner in Iowa but endured several difficult moments Thursday night, particularly on the issue of driver's licenses for illegal immigrants.
(last Saturday's, Jefferson-Jackson, Iowa, Thursday, night)
After hammering Clinton for two weeks about her lack of clarity on that topic, he had trouble providing a yes-or-no answer Thursday, finally saying that he favored them.
(Clinton, two weeks, Thursday)
Clinton's war room erupted in cheers over his misstep, one campaign official said.
(Clinton, one)
Edwards has chosen to wage a more classic outsider campaign, focused strictly on Clinton.
(Edwards, Clinton)
In Iowa he remains a threat, but there is a question of whether he will be able to keep pace in the final weeks given the huge financial disadvantage he may face against both Clinton and Obama.
(Iowa, the final weeks, Clinton, Obama)
After two lively debates, Clinton's vulnerabilities are more clearly evident and Obama and Edwards have shown they are ready to maintain pressure on her.
(two, Clinton, Edwards)
But both need to stop Clinton in Iowa to change the trajectory of the Democratic race.
(Clinton, Iowa, Democratic)
"I think there are two candidates for whom the race comes down to a one-day sale," Garin said.
(two, one-day, Garin)
Iowa is not a make-or-break event for Senator Clinton, but it probably is for the other two.
(Iowa, Clinton, two)
Clinton was not flawless Thursday.
(Clinton, Thursday)
Her answer on trade issues left questions her opponents will attempt to exploit -- Edwards's campaign jumped quickly on this Friday morning -- and she still has not made clear exactly what she thinks about payroll taxes and Social Security.
(Edwards, Friday, morning, Social Security)
Obama, Edwards and some of Clinton's other rivals are likely to try to focus continued attention on character questions such as whether she is candid or calculated, honest or evasive -- areas that polls show could be genuine vulnerabilities.
(Edwards, Clinton)
But in general, Thursday's debate was far better for Clinton than for her rivals.
(Thursday, Clinton)
After Philadelphia the question was how she would respond.
(Philadelphia,)
That's the question now facing Obama and Edwards.

Congress Urged to Pass Vet Bill

Leaders of a presidential commission on Wednesday implored Congress to quickly pass measures providing lifetime treatment to Iraq war veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder.

Testifying before a House panel, former Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., and former Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala said they didn't want current clashes between Congress and the Bush administration over the future of Iraq to overshadow the immediate health needs of thousands of veterans with both physical and mental injuries.

In July, the nine-member commission released a report urging changes that would boost benefits for family members caring for the wounded, establish an easy-to-use Web site for medical records and revamp the way disability pay is awarded.
(July, nine)
The vast majority of its proposals 29 of the 35 require action by the White House, Pentagon or Department of Veterans Affairs.

Dole and Shalala said the White House was preparing a package of legislative proposals in the coming week that in some cases could go beyond what the commission recommended by offering lifetime pharmacy benefits for some injured veterans.
(Dole, Shalala, the White House, the coming week)
The commission is also seeking legislation that would allow the VA to provide lifetime PTSD treatment for any Iraq war veteran who needs it, regardless of the length of time that transpires whether months or years before symptoms emerge.
(VA, Iraq, months, years)
They cited the prolonged and repeated deployments for 500,000 service members, which increased the risk for mental health problems.

"The consequences of PTSD can be devastating," Shalala said.

The longer service members are in the field, the more likely they are to experience events, which can lead to symptoms of PTSD.

The commission leaders also urged a restructuring of the veterans' disability pay systems to shift more responsibility for awarding benefits away from the Pentagon and the VA.

But under questioning from lawmakers, Dole and Shalala said they did not review current problems of severe backlogs in processing disability benefits at the VA and said they had no solution.

Welcome to the Frozen Section
(the Frozen Section,)
Cathy Ann Cimoch has a point of view on the frozen section -- frozen embryos, that is.
(Cathy Ann Cimoch,)
Perhaps that seems like a joke in bad taste, but I couldn't help myself, really.
()
It's become as common for couples today as ... well, visiting the grocery store.
(today,)
When you meet Cimoch, you realize that she's got a sense of humor about it, too.
(Cimoch,)
I mean, how else does one raise six kids -- quadruplets who are 8 years old and twins who are 2 years old -- and not have a sense of humor?
(one, six, 8 years old, 2 years old)
How could you get through the day?
(the day,)
And the answer to the question that's on your mind: Yes, she does have help.
()
But only one nanny, and she doesn't live in.
(only one,)
I have one child and a live-in nanny.
(one,)
I can barely cope sometimes.
()
I never get enough sleep, and now that he's in preschool, fuggetaboutit.
()
Cimoch's husband, Paul, is an infectious disease specialist and is quite busy, as you can imagine, but he certainly is an involved father.
(Paul,)
But just between all the moms out there and me, women really do most of the child rearing, even when they have careers -- and nannies.
()
It's just the way it is.
()
The way it always has been.
()
The way it always will be.
()
Bunsen Burners and Petri Dishes?
(Petri Dishes,)
Back to the six kids.
(six,)
As you may have guessed, frozen embryos come from the in vitro process.
()
The phrase "test tube baby" is often used to refer to children conceived through IVF -- short for in vitro.
(IVF,)
I'm not sure I like that term.
()
It sounds ... unnatural.
()
Frankly speaking, in vitro is not a natural process, but it's not un-natural, either.
()
It's the helping hand of science that comes into play when a couple experiences infertility.
()
Infertility affects about 6.1 million people in the United States, which is roughly 10 percent of men and women of reproductive age.
(Infertility, about 6.1 million, the United States, roughly 10 percent)
The first test tube baby was born in 1981.
(first, 1981)
God, what that child must have experienced from the media!
()
At least its name wasn't mentioned.
()
Although 1981 isn't that long ago, the term "test tube baby" sounds very, very outdated.
(1981,)
Since then, more than 250,000 babies have been born using the IVF method.
(more than 250,000, IVF)
When I snidely asked Cimoch if a petri dish and Bunsen burner were used in the process, I realized from her answer that I wasn't that far off.
(Cimoch, Bunsen)
No on Bunsen burners; yes on petri dishes.
()
A man's sperm and a woman's egg are combined in a petri dish, where fertilization occurs.
()
The resulting embryos -- yes, they are called embryos that early on -- are then transferred to the woman's uterus, implanted in the walls, and from then on out, it's up to nature.
()
You could just call it a helping hand, although many people are still on the fence about the process.
()
According to Cimoch, five embryos were implanted in her womb eight years ago.
(Cimoch, five, eight years ago)
Why so many, you ask?
()
Because the attrition rate can vary, especially with age.
()
Just how much it can vary is a question that remains unanswered.
()
But I can tell you this: The pregnancy rate by age using IVF is similar to that of ""normally," if you will, conceived pregnancies.
(IVF,)
Thirty-seven percent among women younger than 35, 28 percent for women between the ages of 36 and 39, and about 13 percent for women over 40.
(Thirty-seven percent, 35, 28 percent, between the ages of 36, 39, about 13 percent)
Cimoch is 46 years old, so she was 38 when the five embryos were implanted.
(46 years old, 38, five)
There is a bit of a blank here as far as research goes as to why so many embryos are implanted and why so many people are either choosing not to keep all the embryos or why there are an increasing number of multiples out there.
()
My educated guess, after much research of my own on this topic, is that five embryos, conceived via IVF or not, do not usually all survive the 10 months of pregnancy.
(five, the 10 months)
But four of five did in Cimoch's case.
(four, five, Cimoch)
And it couldn't have happened to a better person.
()
I love hearing her discuss how she found out.
()
She was having an ultrasound and had her husband on the phone.
()
The technician did his/her thing and ran the ultrasound over her belly, listening for heartbeats.
()
First it was, "I hear a heartbeat."
(First,)
Then: "I hear another heartbeat."
()
And so it goes.
()
Cimoch almost passed out.
()
Who wouldn't?
()
Accepting the Outcomes
(Outcomes,)
Not funny, but this is a common dilemma today.
(today,)
With more and more couples using in vitro fertilization, there come consequences.
()
I was compelled by Cimoch's thoughtfulness and willingness to share her heart and soul on a topic that is -- for the most part -- taboo.
(Cimoch,)
Cimoch and her husband wanted a big family.
()
As they each had some problems, they went to a fertility clinic for in vitro treatments and ... they hit the jackpot the first time.
(first,)
And I mean big time!
()
They got eight viable embryos and had five implanted.
(eight, five)
Nine months later, the stork brought them four children.
(Nine months later, four)
Down the line a few years, Cimoch didn't know what to do with the other frozen embryos.
(a few years, Cimoch)
Not a dilemma you have every day.
()
With four mouths to feed, clothe, bathe and watch over constantly, she made a choice many wouldn't have made.
(four,)
She had the remaining frozen embryos implanted, and had twins.
()
This is what I call brave.
()
Upon entering her house, I was expecting complete mayhem, but this is a woman who works.
()
Her husband is a doctor, and they seem to have it all under control.
()
I have one child and it still takes me hours to fold up the carriage and put it in the trunk.
(one, hours)
I see people looking at me, thinking, "She can't even fold up a carriage, how does she manage to raise her child?"
()
I think the same sometimes, as do all mothers every once in a while.
()
I had to ask Cimoch flat out, "Does your house really look like this all the time?
()
All neat and clean with no toys scattered hither and tither?
()
And does she look so put together all the time?
()
Her answer: "Are you kidding?

Sometimes I don't shower for four days.

()
She went on to say that she knew things had changed for her when her kids got older and, "you know you no longer have to look for elastic waist pants, you can actually manage to shave your legs and underarms, and you can use separate shampoo and conditioner instead of just settling for the two-in-one kind."

By the way, when I spoke with her, she was out with a group of the girls in the Hamptons, clearly having a good time.

Obviously, despite his teasing nature, she was a bit down.
()
She went to a park to think on it, and she "found four 4-leaf clovers."
(four,)
When does that ever happen?
()
I looked for hours in camp when I was supposed to be looking for dry firewood and I came up with nothin.

Well guess what?

Dismore was pregnant and didn't know it.
()
She ended up having quadruplets on St. Patrick's Day.

Ah, the luck of the Irish.

I personally would be in an institution if I had four kids at once, but I certainly garnered a lot of respect for these women who used fertility drugs and accepted the consequences.

Would we all be so courageous when faced with such decisions?

Either choice is hard to make.
()
I would need four nannies, or have to find nicer homes for them.

Joel graced me with his humor again: "It's really hard to give away quadruplets.

You have to put up a whole lot of fliers.

He's right!

It's not like there are many options.

A Resolute Ending To Our Trip
()
CBS / Chloe Arensberg
(CBS / Chloe Arensberg,)
RESOLUTE, Nunavut, Canada  Nothing about surviving in the High Arctic is easy.
(Nunavut, Canada )
From the harsh climes to the isolation to the difficulty getting around, anyone here must contend with a vast expanse of untamed wilderness.
()
Not that you have to tell that to the 229 or so Inuit and scientists who live here.
(229 or so, Inuit)
We've been in Resolute for three days now, and as brief (southern) visitors, it'd be difficult to remain much longer.
(three days,)
My wool hat's off to those who can make it.
()
After three weeks away from home during this Arctic odyssey, tomorrow we return.
(three weeks, Arctic, tomorrow)
It's nearly mid-summer, so almost all the ice and snow has disappeared here on Cornwallis Island, though locals tell us it vanished sooner than in years past.
(mid-summer, Cornwallis Island, years past)
What remains is barren tundra, featureless and devoid of trees, where little is able to grow.
()
I find myself wishing there was more white stuff to cover the desert-like ground.
()
Somehow it would make more sense when I look around.
()
It's also been bitingly windy since we arrived, stirring up dust everywhere.
()
Gusts exceed 50 miles per hour.
(50 miles per hour,)
We've driven along the western side of the island, but the roads are extremely rocky and eventually they simply run out.
()
Looking out to sea there are pockets of ice floes, and we've encountered a few collections of seal bones.
()
I'm sure I spotted a polar bear in the distance at one point.

We're told in the fall months they routinely lumber through town.
(the fall months,)
The Hamlet of Resolute, as it's known, consists of a handful of gravel tracks weaving amongst a couple dozen low-rise structures.
(The Hamlet of Resolute, a couple dozen)
That's pretty much it.
()
The air of relative poverty or perhaps resignation (or disinterest?) is impossible to deny.
()
All it takes is a short walk.
()
That said I haven't talked to enough locals to positively equate disrepair with despair.
()
(Like today we talked to Ludy, who's been here since 1959 and is proud to call Resolute home.
(Ludy, 1959)
So what do I know?)
()
We see very few Inuit during the day.
(Inuit, the day)
Some are sleeping (possibly preferring the cooler air of the night, we're told), and we usually just catch the occasional laughing children chasing one another or people shopping at the Co-op.
()
It's like they're usually shuttered up indoors unless necessity brings them out.
()
Of course who could blame them with this wind.
()
And that gives rise to the unavoidable question about yearlong, permanent life in Resolute: What else is there to do?
(about yearlong,)
Resolute's rather short history dates back to 1947 as an airfield and weather station.
(1947,)
Several years later a handful of Inuit were relocated from northern Quebec to here in Resolute as part of Canada's claim to the region.
(Several years later, Inuit, Quebec, Canada)
The bare bones infrastructure has gradually built up over time, especially when the lack of decent amenities was revealed.
()
Now there are vehicles and a store and a school and a community hall and a few hotels and even a couple of fire trucks, as we found out yesterday when a small fire broke out.
(yesterday,)
In a frozen nutshell, 60 years later and here we are.
(60 years later,)
Important note: The territory of Nunavut is a huge place, and Resolute is just a tiny part of it.
(Nunavut,)
We've anecdotally talked to as many people as we could track down.
()
On our first day in Resolute we spoke with some McGill University archeology students who are digging nearby at a site of where a group of Thule people lived some 800 years ago.
(our first day, McGill University, some 800 years ago)
Those ancestors of the Inuit may have headed east from Alaska to follow the whales due to a warming trend at the time.
(Inuit, Alaska)
A reminder that climate change is nothing new.
()
The trick today is getting solid baseline data in the Arctic where the current change is happening relatively fast.
(today, Arctic)
Research here is critical to our understanding of global warming, but the amount of quality measurements only goes back roughly 20-30 years.
(roughly 20-30 years,)
So as Marty Bergmann, an Arctic scientist with the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans and a key player in the International Polar Year put it to me: How do you predict a definitive future trend based on a few decades of study when these types of oceanographic, land-based and atmospheric changes are minutely analyzed on a centurial (or larger) scale?
(Marty Bergmann, Arctic, the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans, the International Polar Year, a few decades)
While the methodology is complicated the answer is simple: The more we know, the clearer we can see what's ahead.

DeGeneres Not Backing Down In Dog Drama, Insists Pooch Would Be Best Off With The Family He Already Knows
(Dog Drama,)
(AP) Ellen DeGeneres' doggy drama intensified Tuesday after her tearful plea on her talk show led to death threats against the rescue group that took back her adopted dog for violating the contract, according to a spokesman for the agency's owners.
(AP, Ellen DeGeneres', Tuesday)
DeGeneres explained on her show that the Brussels Griffon terrier mix didn't get along with her cats, so she gave it to her hairstylist's family.

The owners of Mutts and Moms claimed that DeGeneres violated the adoption agreement by not informing them that she was giving the dog away and removed Iggy from the hairstylist's home Sunday.

Drinking Alcohol May Protect Lungs, Light To Moderate Alcohol Drinking May Protect Against Lung Disease
()
(WebMD) Drinking alcohol in moderation may help you breathe easier.
()
A new study shows light to moderate drinkers performed better on breathing tests than people who abstain from alcohol.
()
Researchers found that people who drank fewer than two drinks, on average, per day had a nearly 20 percent lower risk of lung disease than nondrinkers.
(fewer than two, nearly 20 percent)
Their results were presented at CHEST 2007, the annual meeting of the American College of Chest Physicians.
(2007, annual, the American College of Chest Physicians)
Researchers studied the relationship between alcohol consumption and lung function in more than 177,000 members of a California health plan who had health examinations between 1964 and 1973.
(more than 177,000, California, between 1964 and 1973)
The participants filled out questionnaires that included questions about the usual number of alcoholic drinks consumed in a day.

Their lung function was also evaluated during their examination for evidence of lung disease.
()
Smokers and those with a previous history of lung or heart disease were eliminated from the final analysis.

Overall, the results showed that people who drank fewer than two alcoholic drinks per day were 18 percent less likely to show signs of lung disease than abstainers.

Those who drank three to five drinks per day had a 10 percent lower risk of lung disease, but heavy drinkers who drank more than six drinks per day had a 9 percent increased risk of lung disease.
(three to five, 10 percent, more than six, 9 percent)
Researcher Stanton T. Siu of Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program and colleagues say the results suggest that light to moderate alcohol drinking may have beneficial effects on lung function, but more research is needed to confirm these effects.

Bush Picks Peake To Head Veterans Affairs, Retired Army General And Doctor Nominated To Direct Strained Department
(Bush, Veterans Affairs)
(AP) President Bush on Tuesday nominated retired Army Lt. Gen. James Peake to direct the embattled Department of Veterans Affairs, which is strained by the influx of wounded troops returning from Iraq and Afghanistan.
(AP, Bush, Tuesday, Army, James Peake, Department of Veterans Affairs, Iraq, Afghanistan)
"He will work tirelessly to eliminate backlogs and ensure that our veterans receive the benefits they need to lead lives of dignity and purpose," Mr. Bush said.
(Bush,)
Peake, 63, is a physician who spent 40 years in military medicine and was decorated for his service in Vietnam.
(63, 40 years, Vietnam)
He retired from the Army in 2004 after being lead commander in several medical posts, including four years as the U.S. Army surgeon general.
(Army, 2004, four years, the U.S. Army)
"He will be the first physician and the first general to serve as secretary," Mr. Bush said.

If confirmed by the Senate, Peake would lead the government's second-largest agency with 235,000 employees in the waning months of the Bush administration.
(Senate, second, 235,000, the waning months, Bush)
The nomination comes as the administration and Congress struggle to find clear answers to some of the worst problems afflicting wounded warriors, such as adequate mental health treatment and timely payment of disability benefits, after disclosures emerged in February of shoddy outpatient treatment at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center.
(Congress, February, the Walter Reed Army Medical Center)
Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., a member of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, said Peake will have to prove he is up to the task of improving the beleaguered veterans care system.

"The burden is on Dr. Peake to prove to veterans around the country that he can be the honest, independent advocate we need to turn the VA around," Murray said.
(Peake, VA, Murray)
Given Dr. Peake's past posts running the Army health care system he will have serious and significant questions to answer about failed preparations for our returning wounded warriors.

Peake, a graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, was awarded the silver star and purple heart for his service in Vietnam as a platoon leader with the 101st Airborne Division.
(the U.S. Military Academy, West Point, Vietnam, the 101st Airborne Division)
He was wounded twice in battle and received his acceptance letter to Cornell University Medical College while in the hospital recovering from injury.

From 2000 to 2004, Peake was surgeon general of the U.S. Army, where he commanded 50,000 medical personnel and 187 army medical facilities across the world.
(the U.S. Army, 50,000, 187)
He also was commanding general of the U.S. Army Medical Department Center and School.

While at HOPE, he helped organize civilian volunteers aboard the Navy hospital ship Mercy as it responded to the tsunami in Indonesia and aboard the hospital ship Comfort which responded to Hurricane Katrina.

In his new post, Peake, the son of a medical services officer and Army nurse, would manage the embattled VA, criticized for poor coordination with the Pentagon in providing medical treatment and disability benefits to millions of veterans.
(Army, VA, Pentagon, millions)
Earlier this year, a presidential commission chaired by former Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., and Donna Shalala, former Health and Human Services Secretary during the Clinton administration, proposed sweeping change that could add to the VA's backlogged system by shifting most of the responsibility in awarding disability benefits from the Pentagon to the VA.
(Earlier this year, Bob Dole, Donna Shalala, Health and Human Services, Clinton, VA, Pentagon, VA)
The VA's backlog is between 400,000 and 600,000 claims, with delays of 177 days.

Earlier this month, Mr. Bush pushed Congress to help modernize the government's veterans system.

Mr. Bush sent legislation to Capitol Hill for implementing those recommendations that require legislative action.

Target Plans New Red Meat Label Policy, To Disclose When Meat Has Been Treated With Carbon Monoxide
()
(AP) Target Corp. said Tuesday it was working to add labels that warn consumers when meat is treated with carbon monoxide to make steaks and chops look fresh as federal regulators faced criticism for allowing a practice that critics call unsafe.
(AP, Target Corp., Tuesday)
Hormel Foods Corp. and Cargill Inc. also announced they would be willing to add similar labeling if necessary.
(Hormel Foods Corp., Cargill Inc.)
All three companies are based in Minnesota.
(three, Minnesota)
"Hormel will comply with any labeling of this product that is determined to be necessary and fair through the legislative or regulatory process," Jeffrey Ettinger, Hormel's chief executive, said during a House hearing.
(Jeffrey Ettinger, House)
The meat industry for years has typically used carbon monoxide in packages to help meat retain its red color, with approval by the Food and Drug Administration and the Agriculture Department.
(years, the Food and Drug Administration, the Agriculture Department)
But consumer advocates say the practice misleads people by making meat look fresh long after its expiration date.
()
But under pressure from congressional Democrats, Target said it had sent a letter to USDA officials seeking to add labels that would urge consumers not to rely solely on color or the "use by" date to judge a product's freshness.
(Democrats, Target, USDA)
Cargill also said it would add labels, subject to USDA approval.
(Cargill, USDA)
Earlier this month, the huge agribusiness company said it was recalling more than 1 million pounds of ground beef that may be contaminated with E. coli bacteria, the second time in less than a month it recalled potentially tainted beef.
(Earlier this month, more than 1 million pounds, second, less than a month)
The cases were not related to carbon monoxide packaging.

(Target,)
All of the meat we sell meets or exceeds Food and Drug Administration and United States Department of Agriculture guidelines.
(Food and Drug Administration, United States Department of Agriculture)
Testifying at the House hearing, USDA's Food, Safety and Inspection Service defended its decision to allow sales of the packaged meat without warning labels, saying the use of carbon monoxide was not deceptive.
(House, USDA, Food, Safety and Inspection Service)
The agency pointed to a past study it said found that consumers rely primarily on the sell-by date, rather than color, to determine a product's freshness.
()
USDA officials said they would approve Target's proposed labeling if they determine the wording is "truthful and not misleading."
(USDA, Target)
They said they would also consider reevaluating whether mandatory labeling for all packaged meat was appropriate.
()
Under government regulations, the USDA must approve labels for use on meat and poultry products.

"Based on the data presented at the time, FSIS stands by its 2004 decision on the suitability of the use of carbon monoxide in meat packaging," said Daniel Engeljohn, deputy assistant administrator at FSIS.
(2004, Daniel Engeljohn, FSIS)
The latest moves come as the House Energy and Commerce Committee reviews food safety in the wake of a spate of recalls involving items from ground beef to pet food and spinach.
(the House Energy and Commerce Committee,)
In recent weeks, supermarket chains including Safeway, Giant Food and Stop & Shop have agreed to stop selling meats packaged in carbon monoxide after the House panel wrote letters expressing concern and seeking information.
(recent weeks, Safeway, Giant Food and Stop & Shop, House)
Those letters were signed by Democrats John Dingell, the committee chairman, and Bart Stupak, who chairs the committee's oversight panel.
(Democrats, John Dingell, Bart Stupak)
The two lawmakers are pushing legislation that would make food labeling mandatory.
(two,)
"Carbon monoxide does nothing to prolong food shelf life and carbon monoxide does not make food safer," said Stupak, pointing to internal Hormel e-mail that he said showed the technique was not safe.
()
"The sole purpose of using carbon monoxide is to fool consumers," he said.
()
USDA and the FDA have joint responsibility in reviewing the listing of ingredients used in packaging meat and poultry.
(USDA, FDA)
The FDA has said that carbon monoxide is not a food additive that would require a more rigorous review.
(FDA,)
Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., criticized Democrats for seeking to tie carbon monoxide in meat packaging to food safety.
(Marsha Blackburn, Democrats)
No conclusive evidence exists linking such packaging to food-borne illnesses or death, she said, and consumers can be trusted to check the sell-by date or use their nose to check for spoilage.
()
Wenonah Hauter, executive director of Food & Water Watch, disagreed.
(Wenonah Hauter, Food & Water Watch)
"Regrettably, we're spending more and more time watchdogging an agency charged with protecting our safety," she said, citing the FDA's unwillingness to undertake a closer review.

Study: Kids who cut back by age 5-and-a-half don't have behavioral issues
(age 5-and-a-half,)
Updated: 11:16 a.m.

CHICAGO - Young children's television viewing presents a dilemma to parents aware of potential harm to development, but a study released on Monday said children who stop watching so much by age 5-and-a-half do not exhibit problems.
(CHICAGO, Monday, age 5-and-a-half)
A number of studies have demonstrated negative effects of heavy television viewing.

However, timing of exposure is an important consideration," said study author Kamila Mistry of Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

"Reducing viewing to acceptable levels can reduce the risk of behavioral and social problems," she concluded, based on the study published in Pediatrics, the journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics.
(Pediatrics, the American Academy of Pediatrics)
The pediatricians' group has issued guidelines that discourage television viewing among children younger than 2 years, and recommend children older than 2 limit their viewing to less than two hours daily.
(2 years, less than two hours, daily)
The group also recommends against having a television in a child's bedroom.

"Despite these recommendations, many young children are consuming significantly more than two hours of television," the report said.
(more than two hours,)
No TV in bedrooms The researchers analyzed interviews conducted three years apart with the mothers of roughly 2,700 children to learn the children's viewing habits and whether they tended to be anxious, depressed, have sleep problems, have trouble concentrating, exhibit aggressive behavior or lack social skills.
(three years, roughly 2,700)
Sixteen percent of the children in the study had watched television more than two hours daily at the age of 2-and-a-half, but then cut back on viewing by the age of 5-and-a-half.
(Sixteen percent, more than two hours, daily, 2, 5)
"Children who reduced their viewing by 5-and-a-half years of age were not at greater risk for behavior or social problems," said Dr. Cynthia Minkovitz, who also worked on the study.
(5, Cynthia Minkovitz)
The one out of five children who watched at least two hours of television a day throughout the study period were at greatest risk of behavioral problems.

Also, children who developed the TV-watching habit by age 5 were at somewhat higher risk.

FDA aims to reduce conflicts of interest
(FDA,)
Rules would disclose outside advisers" financial ties to drugs under review
()
WASHINGTON - The Food and Drug Administration announced proposed rules Thursday to reduce potential conflicts of interest among outside experts who advise the government on approval of drugs and other regulated products.
(WASHINGTON, The Food and Drug Administration, Thursday)
The experts would have to disclose any financial ties to the industry under review.
()
Experts on the advisory committees would have to fill out a form disclosing the potential conflicts and explaining why they should still be able to advise the agency.
()
If the FDA agrees to a waiver, the disclosure form would be posted on the FDA's Web site, typically at least 15 days before the committee meets.
(FDA, FDA, at least 15 days)
Under the current system, outside advisers disclose potential conflicts to the FDA.

Scanning for security - and the perfect jeans
()
Whole-body scanner was initially designed for detecting concealed weapons

By Bryn Nelson
(Bryn Nelson,)
updated 7:35 p.m.
(7:35 p.m.,)
A man enters a clear cylindrical chamber resembling the outer shell of a revolving door and steps onto a curious-looking doormat.
()
A few seconds later, security personnel at an airport would know whether he was carrying a handgun or plastic explosives.
(A few seconds later,)
At the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland, Wash., he's just as apt to leave armed with a printout telling him that a pair of Levi's 514 slim 38 x 32 jeans will fit him to a T.
(the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, Wash., 514, 38, 32)
Researchers at the lab had security in mind when they designed their whole-body scanner as a hands-off approach for detecting concealed weapons.
()
In an "Aha!" moment, staff engineer Doug McMakin and his collaborators also realized the technology could precisely measure the human body.
(Doug McMakin,)
Using a radio wave-based technology that repeatedly "illuminates" the body from top to bottom, the scan can indeed pick out security threats hidden beneath a shirt or pair of pants - whether metal or plastic.
()
But as the technology arrives in airports and courthouses around the country, including a trial run at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport that began in October, the application is also being hailed as a quick, easy and shame-free way to help shoppers find that perfect fit.
(Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, October)
"It's like you go to a photographer and the camera makes an image," said McMakin, who demonstrated the technology during the annual New Horizons in Science conference.
(McMakin, annual, New Horizons in Science)
The scanner's image, though, is produced by bathing the body in harmless, low-powered radio waves that cannot penetrate the skin past one-tenth of an inch - unlike deeper penetrating X-rays.
(one-tenth,)
The scanning signals are similar to those used by cell phones, in fact, though cell phone radio waves are actually 350 times more powerful.
(350,)
The millimeter wave holographic scanning technology, as McMakin and his colleagues call it, produces a "point cloud" of more than 200,000 reflected signals that are transferred to a high-speed computer.
(McMakin, more than 200,000)
Depending on the application, the result can be an accurate and high-resolution body image or a set of neck, waist and inseam measurements.
()
Once inside the "Transporter Room," as it's jokingly called at the laboratory, an over-sized wand resembling a rolled-up gray carpet revolves around a person who has been instructed to leave keys and other pocket contents behind and stand motionless on a centered mat (a third printed instruction: "Click heels together three times, reciting, "There's no place like Rome, there's no place like Rome, there's no place like Rome." ")
(third, three, Rome, Rome, Rome)
Within the revolving wand, 196 tiny antennae repeatedly send out and receive the radio waves.
(196,)
After a 10-second scan, simulated shoppers at the national lab are unlikely to find themselves transported to cobbled streets and shouts of "Ciao, bello!" but instead are greeted with a printout telling them in plain English which pair of ruler straight or "matchstick" skinny jeans are made just for them.

(Albert Charpentier, Intellifit, Malaysia, U.S.)
Although Charpentier said his company was initially looking for a solution to ill-fitting clothes bought online, he expects to begin rolling out Intellifit kiosks in high-volume shopping malls, where shoppers will be able to select fabrics and colors by hand and receive custom-fit jeans in the mail two weeks later.
(Charpentier, two weeks later)
It helps that the design of the scanning chamber is attention-grabbing, Charpentier said.
(Charpentier,)
And the technology is quick and noninvasive, he pointed out, unlike other existing body-measurement methods that require shoppers to get undressed and put on tights before having their picture taken.
()
Versions used to select best-fit clothes for impatient or exacting customers don't produce actual body images, while versions used by airports capture computer images in which travelers appear bald and naked, but with blurred faces.
()
To address privacy concerns, security personnel monitor the computer images in a remote location where they never see the individual.
()
The technology, licensed to Woburn, Mass.-based L-3 Communications for security applications, has been incorporated into more than 100 security systems around the world, from the Cook County Courthouse in Illinois to Baghdad's Green Zone.
(Woburn, L-3 Communications, more than 100, the Cook County Courthouse, Illinois, Baghdad)
At the Phoenix airport, Transportation Security Administration personnel are trying out the scanner as a secondary screening alternative for passengers who'd rather not be frisked.

Additional tests are planned for New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport and Los Angeles International Airport.
(New York's, John F. Kennedy International Airport, Los Angeles International Airport)
McMakin and his collaborators at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory are already looking ahead to other potential uses such as more accurate body mass indexes for the health industry; body-perfect avatars or interactive human animations for the gaming industry; form-fitting and ergonomic car seats and office chairs; and accurate measurements for prosthetic devices.
(McMakin, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory)
Although he's excited about the range of applications, McMakin later said he has a rather personal interest in using the technology to find out how he'd look in a suit and tie or pair of jeans - without having to try them on.

"I don't like to shop," he readily admitted.

So in Wednesday's New York Times - a paper I enjoy reading while having my problem areas tweezed and sculpted into a topiary - I was shocked to find Maureen Dowd mentioning me in her column about Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

The U.S. Agriculture Department Monday said consumers can play a large role in making sure they do not eat any of the 21.7 million pounds of ground beef recalled by Topps Meat Company LLC that may contain the E. coli bacteria.

Products affected by this expanded recall were distributed to retail grocery stores and food service institutions throughout the United States including Pathmark Stores (PTMK) and Wal-Mart Stores (WMT).

Based on consumption patterns, Topps said it believes that the vast majority of the recalled product has been consumed.

Raymond said USDA sent a food safety assessment team to Topps and found it did not follow proper meat-handling procedures.

The company, which is the largest U.S. producer of frozen hamburger patties, kept meat from one day's operations and then mixed it into the next day's run, Raymond said.

In the final days before the special election to decide who will replace the seat vacated by Massachusetts Rep. Martin Meehan, Tsongas, the wife of the late Sen.

Woods aims to cut the playoff gap

LEMONT, Illinois (AP) -- Tiger Woods should have no shortage of fond memories at Cog Hill, where he has won three times at the Western Open and where he made the cut for the first time in a regular PGA Tour event at the age of 19.

Woods is nearly 5,000 points behind in the PGA Tour Playoffs.

"This is where it happened," he said Wednesday morning on the par-3 second hole.

Then he paused.

"Hit a shank right over there into the trees," he said, pointing at a 45-degree angle.

And I still finished second.

This would be a good time for Woods to conjure up some good memories, not to mention good golf, at what is now called the BMW Championship.

Finchem spoke to Mickelson on Tuesday, but declined to discuss any of their differences or speak to how Mickelson chose to use his national TV interview after winning in Boston to disclose his complaints about Finchem.

"I feel comfortable that we did a good job reaching out to the players on the details," he said.

There's a lot on the line, too, and that's why I'm playing.

LONDON, England (AP) -- British Airways divided its largest aircraft order in nine years between Airbus and Boeing on Thursday, giving the European plane manufacturer an edge over its U.S. rival as the airline prepares to increase capacity on its long-haul routes.
(LONDON, England, AP, British Airways, nine years, Airbus, Boeing, Thursday, European, U.S.)
The A380 superjumbo will form part of BA's largest plane purchase in nearly a decade.
(BA, nearly a decade)
BA's decision to book a dozen Airbus A380 superjumbos along with 24 Boeing 787 Dreamliners in a much-anticipated order worth $8.2 billion (€5.8 billion) at list prices ends decades of Boeing's dominance in providing planes to the carrier.
(BA, dozen, Airbus, 24, $8.2 billion, €5.8 billion, decades, Boeing)
It is also a vote of confidence in Airbus' previously troubled double-decker A380 -- deliveries of the aircraft were delayed for two years because of wiring and other technical problems that cost the company billions of euros.
(Airbus, two years, billions)
BA Chief Executive Willie Walsh said that the airline had opted for the A380 rather than Boeing's newly revamped 747-8 for environmental and economic reasons.
(BA, Willie Walsh, Boeing, 747-8)
Watch why this order by British Airways is significant

The 525-seat Airbus plane will enable BA to increase capacity on its flights out of the congested Heathrow Airport, where takeoff slots are limited, to destinations including Hong Kong, Los Angeles and San Francisco.
(525, Airbus, BA, Heathrow Airport, Hong Kong, Los Angeles, San Francisco)
BA will use the 250-seat Boeing 787s to build up new routes, including destinations that the airline's existing fleet of Boeing 767s and 747s cannot serve.
(BA, 250, Boeing, 787s, Boeing, 747s)
"We see opportunities in South America, Asia and North America," said Walsh.
(South America, Asia, North America, Walsh)
The new planes will be delivered between 2010 and 2014, allowing BA to expand its capacity by up to 4 percent per year.
(between 2010 and 2014, BA, up to 4 percent)
Analysts say that is important for the Europe's third-largest airline to keep up with competitors that have more aggressively expanded their long-haul fleets since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the United States.
(Europe, third, the September 11, 2001, the United States)
Virgin Atlantic Airways' passenger total grew 16 percent last year, eight times the growth at BA.

Walsh also stressed the green credentials of the airline's new purchases, noting they will "contribute significantly" to its target of improving fuel efficiency by 25 percent between 2005 and 2025.
(25 percent, between 2005 and 2025)
BA has also taken options to buy 18 more Dreamliners and seven more A380s, and Walsh said that the airline is continuing to look at Airbus' medium-range A350XWB, which has been delayed until 2013 after unhappy customers forced an expensive redesign, and Boeing's 777-300ER.
(BA, 18, seven, A380s, Walsh, Airbus, 2013, Boeing, 777)
"We didn't feel we had sufficient clarity on each so we are continuing negotiations over the next 18 months," he said.
(the next 18 months,)
Analysts said that the rivalry between the two plane manufacturers had likely resulted in a significant discount on the list prices for the order announced Thursday.
(two, Thursday)
"Pricing may have played a role, as British Airways was able to play Boeing off against Airbus," said Howard A. Rubel at Jeffries & Co.
(British Airways, Boeing, Airbus, Howard A. Rubel, Jeffries & Co.)
Collins Stewart analyst Andrew Fitchie said that BA probably paid closer to $6 billion.
(Collins Stewart, Andrew Fitchie, BA, $6 billion)
Rubel said the A380 probably also benefited from its use of engines made by Rolls-Royce, which also power the 787 and have proved attractive to BA.
(Rubel, Rolls-Royce, 787, BA)
The 747, on the other hand, is powered exclusively by General Electric Co.-made engines.
(747, General Electric)
BA's shares rose 4 percent to 384.25 pence ($7.78) after the long-awaited fleet order announcement, which Fitchie said reinforced the fact that "BA looks cheap on every measure."
(BA, 4 percent, 384.25 pence, 7.78, Fitchie, BA)
"The 30 percent discount to its peers reflects a lack of confidence in the outlook, driven by worries over the knock-on effect of the credit crisis to premium demand," he said.
(The 30 percent,)
We are optimistic that next week's September traffic stats release will show a good trading performance and we understand forward bookings and premium demand remain strong.

House passes revised child health insurance bill
(House,)
WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The House of Representatives passed a new bill expanding a popular children's health insurance program Thursday -- despite Republican complaints about a vote held while several members were visiting wildfire-ravaged California districts.
(WASHINGTON, CNN, The House of Representatives, Thursday, Republican, California)
The 265-142 vote was short of the two-thirds margin needed to override another veto by President Bush, who killed a similar bill earlier this month.
(265, two-thirds, Bush, earlier this month)
Nevertheless, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Democrats were "very pleased with what happened today."

"Of course, we would have liked to have had the 290 votes," said Pelosi, D-California.

The measure would expand the program by nearly $35 billion over five years, the same as the measure Bush vetoed October 3.

"This bill does not address in a meaningful way the concerns the president raised, and so he will veto it if it reaches his desk," the White House said in a statement released after the vote.

Bush had proposed adding $5 billion to the program, and said the version he vetoed would have encouraged families to leave the private insurance market for the federally funded, state-run program.
(Bush, $5 billion)
The program currently covers about 6 million children whose parents earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, the federal health insurance program for the poor, but who can't afford private insurance.

Democrats want to extend the program to another 4 million, paying for it with a 61-cent-per-pack increase in the federal tax on cigarettes.
(Democrats, another 4 million, 61-cent)
The revised bill now goes to the Senate, which passed the earlier version with 67 votes.
(Senate, 67)
Despite Democrats' talk of having new momentum, one Republican who joined them on the override vote -- Rep. Vern Ehlers of Michigan -- voted against the new bill.

"How long are we going to play these games before we get serious about resolving our differences?" asked House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio.

VALENCIA, Spain -- Two goals by Steffen Iversen left Valencia's qualifying bid in the balance and Norwegian side Rosenborg dreaming of reaching the knockout stages of the Champions League for the first time since 1996/97.

Rosenborg were expected to finish last in the group, but instead moved up to seven points -- one fewer than leaders Chelsea who were held to a goalless draw at Schalke.

The Norwegians -- who also overcame the Spanish side 2-0 in Trondheim a fortnight ago -- defended heroically and then broke away twice to score through Iversen after 31 and 58 minutes and make it a happy debut in the competition for new coach Trond Henriksen.

Chelsea rode their luck to claim a vital point and Grant said: "We wanted to win but it was not easy to play Schalke at home.

They needed to win because a draw was not good enough.

It was not a bad result but not our best game.

After so many good games in a short time we can have one game that is not in the high level.

It is also an away game against a team who feel very good playing at home.

One blight for Grant was a first half calf injury to goalkeeper Petr Cech.

The Czech international could not return for the second half but Grant could not say how long Cech would be sidelined for.

Schalke heeded the warning and in the 18th minute Mesut Ozil forced Czech international Petr Cech to dive low to his left to gather his speculative 20-yard effort and moments later the Chelsea keeper fumbled a drive from Heiko Westermann.

Drogba, an isolated figure since missing his early chance, tried to take some of the heat off his defense by getting on the end of a pass from Florent Malouda, but was off target with his angled volley.

He then squandered his second great chance in the 41st minute when a mazy run from Joe Cole put the Chelsea striker in the clear.

Children's Museum employee distributed child porn, officials say
(Children's Museum,)
(CNN) -- The chief operating officer of the National Children's Museum was arrested Tuesday and is charged with distributing child pornography over the Internet, authorities said.
(CNN, the National Children's Museum, Tuesday)
Robert A. Singer is accused of sending images depicting child pornography to people he believed to be a 12-year-old girl and her 33-year-old mother, according to a statement issued by U.S. Attorney Michael Garcia of the Southern District of New York.
(Robert A. Singer, 12-year-old, 33-year-old, U.S., Michael Garcia, the Southern District, New York)
In reality he was communicating with an undercover detective for the New York Police Department.

Some of the pornographic images were sent from Singer's computer at the museum, according to an affidavit filed in support of the charges by a special agent who investigates child pornography and child exploitation for U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement.
(Singer, U.S. Immigrations, Customs Enforcement)
The Washington museum posted a message on its Web site saying officials there are "horrified" by news of Singer's arrest.

They reported that he has been suspended from his post, effective immediately, and is barred from the property.

Singer, 49, was arrested at his home in Falls Church, Virginia, by federal agents, according to the prosecutors' statement.
(49, Falls Church, Virginia)
Authorities allege he engaged in several instant messaging "chats" and e-mail communications with the undercover detective, posing as the woman and her daughter, from August to September.

He is charged with five counts of distributing child pornography in interstate commerce.

If convicted on each count, he would face a sentence of up to 140 years in prison -- up to 20 years for the first count and up to 40 years for each additional count, prosecutors said.

Singer allegedly initiated contact with the undercover detective, posing as the mother, in an America On Line chat room called "Cuties."

"On five separate occasions in August 2007, Singer sent several images of child pornography over the Internet to the mother and the daughter, including images depicting sexual acts between minors and adults and images depicting known victims of child exploitation," prosecutors said.
(five, August 2007)
In his communications with the supposed daughter, Singer pretended to be a 15-year-old boy, authorities said.
(15-year-old,)
In August 2007, he sent her two images featuring child pornography, according to the affidavit, with the instruction, "just delete it when you are done."

A search of Singer's AOL account activity showed that from July to September, he sent about 80 images featuring child pornography to people including the detective, authorities said in the statement.

Also, the search revealed that he had received about 10 images and one video depicting child pornography.

He is identified in the complaint as a spokesman for the National Children's Museum, but a spokeswoman who asked not to be identified said he was promoted to chief operating officer within the past few months.

Leahy: White House aides must comply with subpoenas
(Leahy, White House)
WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee rejected White House claims of executive privilege and demanded Thursday that key White House aides testify in the case of the controversial firings of U.S. attorneys.
(WASHINGTON, CNN, the Senate Judiciary Committee, White House, Thursday, White House, U.S.)
Sen. Patrick Leahy ruled that president has no claim of executive privilege protecting Karl Rove and others.
(Patrick Leahy, Karl Rove)
The committee's investigation has found "significant and uncontroverted evidence that the president had no involvement in these firings," Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, said.
(Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont)
Thus, the White House can't claim executive privilege or immunity, which are meant to protect private communications between a president and White House aides, he ruled.
(the White House, White House)
The committee has issued subpoenas for White House chief of staff Josh Bolten and former political advisor Karl Rove, among others.
(White House, Josh Bolten, Karl Rove)
The Bush administration has insisted that last year's firing of the attorneys was handled properly, but critics have charged that they were forced out for political motives and, in one case, to allow a protégé of Rove's to take one of the posts.
(Bush, last year's, one, Rove)
The ruling, which was expected, is a formal step necessary before the committee can vote to find the White House in contempt.
(the White House,)
Such a move would require a vote of the full Senate before being turned over to the U.S. attorney in Washington.
(Senate, U.S., Washington)
The attorney would have to decide whether to prosecute the administration that appointed him.
()
Besides Bolten and Rove, the committee issued subpoenas for former White House political director Sara Taylor and her deputy, Scott Jennings, both of whom Leahy and others on the committee think were involved in making political judgments on which U.S. attorneys to fire.
(Rove, White House, Sara Taylor, Scott Jennings, Leahy, U.S.)
"In light of the evidence gathered by the committee showing the significant involvement of White House political officials in improper politicization of law enforcement, the White House is not entitled to withhold key evidence," Leahy wrote in his ruling.
(White House, the White House, Leahy)
He accused the White House and Justice Department of "lying, misleading, stonewalling, and ignoring the Congress" in its investigation.
(the White House, Justice Department, Congress)
"It is obvious that the reasons given for these firings were contrived as part of a cover-up and that the stonewalling by the White House is part and parcel of the that same effort," Leahy wrote.
(the White House, Leahy)
The White House has offered to allow Rove and others to be interviewed privately about their actions.
(The White House, Rove)
The Democratic-led Congress has rejected that offer, in part, because of White House insistence no transcript be made.
(Democratic, Congress, White House)
The Judiciary Committee is likely to move on the matter in December, an aide to Leahy said.
(The Judiciary Committee, December, Leahy)
Though U.S. attorneys are political appointees who serve at the pleasure of the president, the Justice Department's initial characterization of the dismissals as "performance-related" triggered angry protests from the former prosecutors.

Plan Approved to Retire Yugoslav Domain

WASHINGTON (AP) - Jimmy Rollins and the Philadelphia Phillies have been playing catch-up all season, so it made sense they would overcome one more big deficit.

Cold Meds Not for Kids
()
WASHINGTON (AP) - Very young children simply should not take some commonly used cold and cough medicines, federal health officials say in recommending that the "consult your physician" advice to parents on the labels be dropped.
(WASHINGTON, AP)
The preliminary recommendation, from Food and Drug Administration safety officials, would apply to decongestant use in children under 2, and antihistamines in those younger than 6, according to agency documents released Friday.
(Food and Drug Administration, under 2, 6, Friday)
The more than 350 pages of documents are part of a broad and ongoing FDA examination of whether the roughly 800 medicines, many popular and widely used, are safe and effective in treating children's colds and coughs.
(more than 350, FDA, roughly 800)
FDA advisers are to take up the issue during an Oct. 18-19 meeting.
(FDA, Oct. 18-19)
The FDA has not made a final decision on any label changes.
(FDA,)
Action is likely, pending a recommendation from outside experts.
()
The review came in response to a recently filed petition by Baltimore city officials, who charged that many over-the-counter cough and cold remedies can harm toddlers and preschoolers.
(Baltimore,)
Those officials, joined by the American Academy of Pediatrics, cite evidence that suggests the drugs are not only risky but also don't work in the very young.
(the American Academy of Pediatrics,)
"The basic question is, why should a product be so relentlessly marketed when it's not safe or effective?" said Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, Baltimore's health commissioner.
(Joshua Sharfstein, Baltimore)
It does not make sense, in the absence of information, to say 'consult a physician,' because they do not have superhuman powers.

They cannot make a product safe or effective.

The Consumer Healthcare Products Association, which represents makers of over-the-counter medicines, backs the recommendation that the cold and cough treatments not be used in children younger than 2.
(The Consumer Healthcare Products Association, 2)
Separately, for antihistamines, the group recommends adding a warning that the drugs not be used to sedate young children, president Linda Suydam said.
(Linda Suydam,)
An FDA review of side-effect records filed with the agency between 1969 and September 2006, found 54 reports of deaths in children associated with decongestant medicines made with pseudoephedrine, phenylephrine or ephedrine.
(FDA, between 1969 and September 2006, 54)
It also found 69 reports of deaths associated with antihistamine medicines containing diphenhydramine, brompheniramine or chlorpheniramine.
(69, chlorpheniramine)
Most of the deaths were children younger than 2.
(2,)
The Baltimore petition came on the heels of a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that found more than 1,500 toddlers and babies wound up in emergency rooms over a two-year period because of the drugs.
(Baltimore, more than 1,500, two-year)
Also on Friday, the FDA gave drug companies until Oct. 31 to stop making and selling any unapproved prescription medicines labeled for use by children younger than 6 that contain the painkiller and cough suppressant hydrocodone.
(Friday, FDA, Oct. 31)
The move is part of a broader effort to remove from sale an estimated 200 unapproved prescription cough medicines made with the narcotic.
(an estimated 200,)
Manufacturers of any other unapproved hydrocodone medicines, beyond those intended for young children, must stop making them by Dec. 31 and cease shipping them by March 31, 2008, the FDA said.
(Dec. 31, March 31, 2008, FDA)
It said the order applies to most of the hydrocodone formulations sold as cough medicines.

Nor does it apply to pain-relief drugs like Vicodin, which combine hydrocodone and acetaminophen.

NASCAR to Replace Busch With Nationwide
(NASCAR to Replace Busch With Nationwide,)
NEW YORK (AP) - NASCAR was finalizing a deal Tuesday night with Nationwide Insurance to sponsor its No.
(NEW YORK, AP, Tuesday, night, Nationwide Insurance)
2 series beginning in 2008, The Associated Press has learned.

Nationwide will replace Anheuser-Busch, which has sponsored the second-tier Busch Series for 26 seasons but said earlier this year it would end its entitlement deal at the conclusion of this season.
(Anheuser-Busch, second, Busch Series, 26 seasons, earlier this year, this season)
The deal with Nationwide is estimated to be seven years at $10 million a year, according to a person familiar with the negotiations who requested anonymity because the deal had yet to be completed.
(seven years, $10 million)
A-B was paying roughly the same amount, and NASCAR initially had sought an increase in the price of the series.

But despite a flurry of early suitors, NASCAR was unable to secure sponsorship in a search that has stretched nearly 10 months.

A deal with Subway appeared to be imminent in August, but never materialized.

NASCAR officials did not immediately return a call for comment.

In January, Nationwide signed a four-year extension with Speedway Motorsports Inc., owner of six NASCAR tracks.
(January, four-year, Speedway Motorsports Inc., six, NASCAR)
The deal called for the insurance company to build fan zone areas at several of SMI properties.

ESPN worked with NASCAR to find a new sponsor for the series, and it was believed that the advertising requirement held up talks with several companies.

Camp Death Accused: We Followed Policy
()
(AP) - Boot camp guards and a nurse charged with killing a teenage boy testified Tuesday that a videotaped altercation with him seemed like a common case of an offender refusing to exercise - until he became quiet and limp.
(AP, Tuesday)
The 30-minute video of seven guards hitting and kneeing 14-year-old Martin Lee Anderson shocked many and helped prompt the state to close its juvenile boot camps, but defendants who testified Tuesday said it was a by-the-book effort to get him to cooperate.
(30-minute, seven, 14-year-old, Martin Lee Anderson, Tuesday)
"At any time he could have walked, got up, finished the run," guard Charles Helms said.
(Charles Helms,)
Helms is among seven guards and a nurse charged with manslaughter in the death of Anderson, who died at a hospital a day after the Jan. 5, altercation.
(seven, Anderson, the Jan. 5)
Defense attorneys contend their clients followed policy and say Anderson died because of a previously undiagnosed blood disorder.
(Anderson,)
The nurse, Kristin Schmidt, cried on the witness stand Tuesday as she told jurors she believed she did everything she could to prevent the boy's death.
(Kristin Schmidt, Tuesday)
Schmidt said she did not observe anything medically wrong with Anderson throughout the altercation.
(Schmidt, Anderson)
Schmidt testified that Anderson did not appear to be injured by the repeated blows, the application of ammonia capsules, wrist restraints and other techniques used by the guards.
(Schmidt, Anderson)
Though Anderson complained of not being able to breathe, Schmidt said, the boy was able to breathe fine and answer questions.
(Anderson, Schmidt)
She said that when Anderson stopped answering the guards' questions and became limp, she instructed the guards to call 911.
(Anderson, 911)
Schmidt said her job called on her to interfere with the guards only "if I saw something that would cause an injury."
(Schmidt,)
"They don't punish kids at the boot camp," she said.
()
I know when they use control techniques they have their reasons.

Prosecutor Mike Sinacore played the video for Schmidt and asked whether she considered Anderson's "wobbly legs" a medical concern.
(Mike Sinacore, Schmidt, Anderson)
Schmidt said Anderson moved his legs after ammonia capsules were applied and that she could not tell whether he was feigning illness.
(Schmidt, Anderson)
Schmidt said she was accustomed to youths faking illness to avoid exercise.
(Schmidt,)
"There was at least one on every intake day," she said of her 11 years at the camp.
(her 11 years,)
Helms and two other guards who testified earlier Tuesday said they did not initially see Anderson's condition as a medical emergency and the main concern was to get the teen to comply with orders.
(two, earlier Tuesday, Anderson)
Helms, a supervisor, said Anderson showed "signs of life" throughout the altercation.
(Anderson,)
Prosecutors said Helms purposely left out details on the incident report.
(Helms,)
Helms blamed it on shock and lack of sleep, because he traveled from the Panama City boot camp to the Pensacola hospital where Anderson died.

Prosecutor Scott Harmon walked guard Raymond Hauck through a two- minute section of the video in which Hauck repeatedly applied an ammonia capsules to a limp Anderson and lifted his limp body.

Hall Blasts Falcons' Release of Jackson
(Hall Blasts Falcons',)
(AP) - The Atlanta Falcons can't even enjoy an off week.

The new starting quarterback headed to the operating table, while the Pro Bowl cornerback accused the team of giving up on the season with nine games left.

(this morning, first, two, Atlanta, this week)
Petrino has some healing to do in the locker room after the team cut defensive tackle Grady Jackson on Tuesday.
(Grady Jackson, Tuesday)
DeAngelo Hall, a two-time Pro Bowler, ripped Petrino and the front office for getting rid of the 35-year-old Jackson, who was the leader among Atlanta's defensive linemen with 21 tackles, including 5 1/2 for losses and one sack.

"I don't know what kind of message is being sent to let Grady go," Hall said.
()
I'm trying to go (all) out on every single snap.
()
But a lot of guys feel like everyone from the top down is kind of turning it in.

Hall already was fined $100,000 and had to sit out the first half of a game for getting into a sideline confrontation with the rookie coach during Week 3.
(100,000, the first half, Week 3)

Rookie Trey Lewis, a sixth-round pick, will take Jackson's spot.

"It had nothing to do with anything but football," the coach said.

It was just the way we wanted to go.

We felt like for our best opportunity to win games, the next nine games that we play, this was the right move to make, and that's really all there is to it.

Hall wasn't buying that logic.

Petrino has come under increasing criticism in the locker room with each loss.

On Wednesday, Hall said Crumpler was speaking on behalf of all veterans when he pointed out that Petrino kept plenty of untested rookies and younger players on the roster.

"We've got so many players that ain't made a play around here," Hall said.
()
It don't make no sense.
()
We gave a lot of people jobs.
()
Now, to sit around here and single Grady out and say he's the reason why (the team is losing)... that's just ludicrous.
()
If they've got something better and more concrete to go off of, I'd love to hear it.
()
But I'm not buying that one.
()
Hall took a more subtle shot at Petrino, who left Louisville after last season for a five-year, $24 million contract with the Falcons.
(Petrino, Louisville, last season, five-year, $24 million, Falcons)
The cornerback has one more year left on his big-money deal.

I can't do that.

I feel as though I can go out and get a ton of money, whether it's here or somewhere else.

I've got a lot of stuff to play for.
()
But he wondered how much effort some of his teammates would give if they felt the Falcons were looking ahead to next season.
(next season,)
"It's kind of hard for the other guys to play 100 percent," Hall said, "knowing that everyone is not on board from the front office on down."

DETROIT (AP) - The United Auto Workers union reached a tentative contract agreement Saturday with the last of the Big Three automakers, Ford Motor Co., concluding a historic round of negotiations that has slashed wages and changed the way health care is provided to retirees.
(DETROIT, AP, The United Auto Workers, Saturday, Ford Motor Co.)
Ford said the deal, if approved by the approximately 54,000 workers affected, will make it more competitive as it tries to halt its sliding U.S. market share.
(Ford, approximately 54,000, U.S.)
Tentative agreement on Ford's four-year contract was reached around 3:20 a.m.
(Ford, four-year, 3:20 a.m.)
EDT without a strike.
()
The UAW held short strikes against General Motors Corp. and Chrysler LLC before reaching agreements with those automakers.
(UAW, General Motors Corp., Chrysler)
Details were not immediately released, but a person briefed on the deal said Ford scaled back plans to close some U.S. plants and has promised to make significant product investments to ensure those plants will remain open for now.
(Ford, U.S.)
The person requested anonymity because the union hadn't released details.
()
In exchange, Ford will be allowed to pay lower wages to thousands of new hires, a provision already agreed to in contracts with GM and Chrysler.
(Ford, thousands, GM, Chrysler)
Ford said the deal allows it to move its estimated $22 billion in retiree health care obligations to a union-run trust.
(Ford, $22 billion)
The company didn't say how much it will have to contribute to the trust.
()
GM and Chrysler have similar agreements in their contracts.
(GM, Chrysler)
"Though we will not discuss the specifics of the tentative agreement until after it becomes final, we believe it is fair to our employees and retirees, and paves the way for Ford to increase its competitiveness in the United States," Joe Laymon, Ford's group vice president for human resources and labor affairs, said in a statement.
(Ford, the United States, Joe Laymon, Ford)
The company has mortgaged its assets - including its blue oval logo - to fund turnaround efforts and has been rapidly losing U.S. market share, from 26 percent in the early 1990s to about 15 percent this year.
(U.S., 26 percent, the early 1990s, about 15 percent, this year)
It is using less than 80 percent of its U.S. plant capacity.
(less than 80 percent, U.S.)
Erich Merkle, vice president of auto industry forecasting for the consulting firm IRN Inc., said the amount Ford must contribute to the health-care trust and the number of workers who will make lower wages are going to be key to determining whether the contract is enough to help Ford.
(Erich Merkle, IRN Inc., Ford, Ford)
Merkle said even if Ford keeps plants open, it may cut shifts, as GM and Chrysler have done.
(Merkle, Ford, GM, Chrysler)
Ford can't price vehicles competitively if it's paying too many workers and keeping too many plants open, he said.
(Ford,)
"They're just delaying the inevitable, and the inevitable is they need to reduce capacity," he said.
()
The market's so competitive.
()
As long as we have this excess capacity situation, there isn't going to be any pricing power.
()
UAW President Ron Gettelfinger said in a statement that the deal encourages Ford to invest in its products while addressing the economic needs of union members.
(UAW, Ron Gettelfinger, Ford)
The UAW's chief Ford negotiator, Bob King, said the union made progress in each of its three goals: winning new product and investment, getting job security and protecting seniority rights.

"We face enormous challenges - and we also have enormous potential," King said in a statement.

Ford also was expected to try to reduce its U.S. hourly work force by 13,000 employees through buyout and early retirement programs, but if wasn't clear if that plan was part of the contract.
(Ford, U.S., hourly, 13,000)
GM and Chrysler included buyouts in their contracts.

Ford is expected to announce this coming week that more than 30,000 hourly workers have taken previous buyout offers.
(Ford, this coming week, more than 30,000, hourly)
Going into this year's contract talks, U.S.-based automakers said they had about a $25-per-hour total labor cost gap, including wages and benefits, when compared with their Japanese rivals that have U.S. factories.
(year, 25, Japanese, U.S.)
The contract may face a tough ratification vote at Ford because of Chrysler's announcement Thursday, less than a week after union ratification of its new four-year contract, that it would lay off 8,500 to 10,000 hourly workers and eliminate shifts at five North American assembly plants.
(Ford, Chrysler, Thursday, less than a week, four-year, 8,500, 10,000, hourly, five, North American)
And shortly after GM's deal was ratified, that company announced it would cut shifts at three plants, affecting 1,700 jobs.
(GM, three, 1,700)
"My concern is if it's a similar agreement negotiated at GM and Chrysler, then it's terrible for the workers and the future," said Gary Walkowicz, a worker and former local union official at a Ford truck plant in Dearborn.

CONCORD, N.H. (AP) - New Hampshire set its earliest-ever presidential primary on Wednesday, deciding on Jan. 8 and claiming its traditional spot as the nation's first in a nomination season pushed almost to New Year's Day of the election year.
(CONCORD, N.H., AP, New Hampshire, Wednesday, Jan. 8, first, New Year's Day, the election year)

(Iowa, five days earlier, Jan. 3)
New Hampshire primaries often have shaped presidential contests - sometimes dramatically - for nearly a century.
(New Hampshire, nearly a century)
Next year's early date, less than seven weeks from now, resulted from states around the country scheduling their own early primaries and caucuses to attract candidates before the major party nominees are chosen.

As a result, both the Democratic and Republican nominees are likely to be effectively known by Feb. 5, when 22 states vote, if not earlier.

Iowa's caucuses have led the schedule for several decades, but New Hampshire has had the initial primary for much longer.

Both parties plan to penalize the states voting before Feb. 5 if their contests are binding; that includes New Hampshire and Michigan.

Iowa and New Hampshire, two small, predominantly white states, traditionally wield disproportionate influence in presidential politics because of the enormous publicity their early contests get.

Democrats tried to leaven the mix this time by adding early contests in Nevada and South Carolina, but Iowa and New Hampshire moved even earlier.
(Democrats, Nevada, South Carolina, Iowa, New Hampshire)
Gardner and other defenders of New Hampshire say the country - and the candidates - are well-served because the primary requires close contact with voters, not just a big advertising budget and name- recognition.

Gardner also insists that New Hampshire has a uniquely probing and democratic political culture, of which the primary - a progressive reform when it began in 1916 - is part.
(New Hampshire, 1916)
He had been prepared to schedule the primary in December if necessary, a possibility that might have benefited Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, the Democratic front-runner nationally and in the state, by giving her opponents less time to catch up.

A December vote might similarly have benefited former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, who leads Republicans in New Hampshire.

The court ordered Conner to take the challenge or surrender the Cup, and Conner responded by beating Fay in a 60-foot catamaran.

Fay later won a court ruling that Conner's catamaran defense was illegal, but that ruling was overturned on appeal.

'Grumpy' England needed for France rugby win, says forwards coach

England need to replicate the "grumpy and horrible" side they showed in the gritty quarter-final win over Australia against tournament hosts France in the World Cup semi-final on Saturday.

"If we were grumpy and horrible last week and we won, I want us to be grumpy and horrible this week," England forwards coach John Wells said, describing the French as a "crack unit."
(last week, this week, John Wells, French)
The English, largely written off as World Cup no-hopers, dominated old foes Australia in the quarter, winning 12-10 thanks to an admirable all-round performance by the pack and four penalties from the boot of Jonny Wilkinson.

Union sets Wednesday strike deadline in Chrysler negotiations
(Wednesday, Chrysler)
Fresh off a two-day strike at General Motors Corp, the United Auto Workers union has set a Wednesday strike deadline for contract negotiations with Chrysler LLC, sources close to the negotiations told AFP Monday.
(two-day, General Motors Corp, the United Auto Workers union, Wednesday, Chrysler LLC, AFP Monday)
The union will not necessarily walk off the job if an agreement is not reached by the deadline of 11 a.m.

(1500 GMT) Wednesday, the source said.
(1500, GMT, Wednesday)
Negotiations could be extended on an hourly or daily basis.

"I think they're close to an agreement but they want to move things along," the source told AFP on condition of anonymity.

The UAW is using a landmark agreement reached with GM as a framework for negotiations with Chrysler.
(UAW, GM, Chrysler)
It is expected to announce on Wednesday whether that contract has been ratified by members.
(Wednesday,)
But officials at Chrysler have said the company's new owner, private equity group Cerberus Capital Management, does not want to pay the cost of transferring the administration of retiree health care to the union.
(Chrysler, Cerberus Capital Management)
That deal is expected to save GM billions in the long run, but Chrysler has far fewer retirees to deal with and stands to save less in the long-term.

Chrysler officials have, however, been pushing the union to grant them the same health care concessions given to struggling GM and Ford Motor Company last year in which the automakers saved billions by having workers pay for part of their health insurance, the source told AFP Monday.
(Chrysler, GM, Ford Motor Company, last year, billions, AFP Monday)
Robert Nardelli, Chrysler's new chief executive officer, has also said he would like to sell off some of the company's assets such as an in-house trucking company and Chrysler's parts warehouses.

Egypt suggests delaying Mideast peace meet

Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Abul Gheit said on Monday that an upcoming US-sponsored Mideast peace conference should be postponed if there is no prior agreement on the basis for the talks.

In a statement, the minister accused "some in Israel of depleting US efforts to come out of the meeting with a credible and binding joint document," and said "there must be serious thought about holding the meeting at another more convenient time."

"Rushing into holding the meeting without an agreement over a substantive and positive document may damage opportunities to achieve a just peace," Abul Gheit said.

Sarkozy faces crunch week as strike festers on
(crunch week,)
French President Nicolas Sarkozy faced a crucial test of resolve Monday as a nationwide rail strike entered its second week and civil servants prepared their own action against his economic reform programme.
(French, Nicolas Sarkozy, Monday, its second week)
For a sixth straight day services on the train network were badly disrupted, and Paris commuters faced another arduous trek to get to work.
(a sixth straight day, Paris)
Roads around the capital were jammed with 200 kilometres (125 miles) of traffic.
(200 kilometres, 125 miles)
However officials at the RATP Paris metro operator said the situation was better than forecast, with one in three underground trains running, while the SNCF rail company reported one in two TGV high-speed trains in operation.
(Paris, metro, one, three, one, two, TGV)
Company figures showed a continuing fall in the number of strikers, with 26 percent at SNCF and 18 percent at RATP.
(26 percent, 18 percent)
The rail strike over pension reform was set to move into Tuesday, when a separate protest movement over pay and jobs by tax officials, hospital staff, postal workers, teachers and other state employees has long been planned.
(Tuesday,)
Still hopes were raised of a possible resolution after unions said they would attend talks on Wednesday.
(Wednesday,)
The government had previously said it would only enter negotiations once the strike was finished, but on Sunday Labour Minister Xavier Bertrand said it would attend Wednesday's talks if there was "a back-to-work dynamic."
(Sunday, Xavier Bertrand, Wednesday)
The strike was called because of plans to overhaul the "special" pensions systems enjoyed by 500,000 workers mainly in the rail and energy sectors.
(500,000,)
These allow workers to retire two and a half years earlier than the rest of the population, and Sarkozy has promised to end that.
(two and a half years earlier,)
The president's adviser on social affairs Raymond Soubie said he was hopeful the transport strike could be defused by mid-week, when the talks are due to start.
(Raymond Soubie, mid-week)
I am reasonably positive we can reach a positive outcome, in other words a progressive return to work....
()
Evidently there are many fewer strikers, as they are a minority now," Soubie said.
(Soubie,)
The government has insisted it will not yield on the central point of the pensions reform, but it has suggested pay rises and other inducements.
()
The management of SNCF has offered unions a financial package worth more than 90 million euros a year to accept the change.
(more than 90 million,)
According to Finance Minister Christine Lagarde, the strike is costing the country between 300 and 400 million euros a day (between 440 and 586 million dollars).

It noted that in the latest opinion poll the number of people who expressed confidence in the president had fallen to 51 percent.

The pro-government Le Figaro described it as a "decisive week for Sarkozy."
(Le Figaro,)
But it said that -- in contrast with previous protest movements in France -- a clear majority of the population opposes the strikers.

It quoted a government-commissioned poll that found 64 percent in favour of the government's pension reforms, and support for the strike at just 33 percent.

On Sunday, several thousand people demonstrated in central Paris against the strike, which has caused major inconvenience and is beginning to hit the economy.

State employees set to protest Tuesday are demanding pay increases and an end to job cuts.

In addition the government faces a campaign by students against a law that allows universities to raise money from private sources, and by magistrates against the closure of local courts.

SNCF management condemned acts of vandalism which it said had been carried out by strikers, including "dumping of ballast on switching-points, theft of keys to prevent trains from starting, firecrackers on the line, closure of signal boxes and obstacles on the tracks."

Funding shortfall 'risking elderly'
()
Councils will be forced to cut back on care for the elderly unless ministers provide billions of pounds in extra funding, it has been claimed.
(billions of pounds,)
Budgets are being stretched by the ageing population and ambitious Government plans for boosting education services and increasing recycling, according to the Local Government Association (LGA).
(the Local Government Association, LGA)
The warning comes as the Treasury prepares to unveil the results of its Comprehensive Spending Review, which allocates cash for the next three years.
(Treasury, Comprehensive Spending Review, the next three years)
Research by the LGA calculates the cost of implementing new policies will be around £7 billion up to April 2011.
(LGA, £7 billion, April 2011)
That includes more than £5.7 billion on improved children's services out of school hours, and nearly £1.2 billion on waste management and encouraging recycling.
(more than £5.7 billion, nearly £1.2 billion)
An extra £2.7 billion will also be needed to fund social care for the elderly because people are living longer.
(£2.7 billion,)
The LGA said services such as meals on wheels and home help could be subject to cutbacks, as could financial assistance for residential care.
(LGA,)
Chairman Sir Simon Milton said: "Councils want to put people first by providing high quality and affordable services for local people but also will need to fund the changes central government has introduced.
(Simon Milton,)
Without the additional funding from central government, councils will be unable to do both and will be forced into having to make extremely tough decisions about which services can be provided.
()
With the increasing demands of caring for an ageing population it will be likely that unless the investment needed in implementing these additional new burdens comes from central government then subsidised care services for older people will have to be heavily restricted or cut.

Brown stands firm on EU 'red lines'

Prime Minister Gordon Brown insisted Britain would not accept an EU reform treaty which breached the UK's "red lines."

He was speaking after talks with European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso in Downing Street, ahead of a crucial summit in Lisbon next week to finalise the treaty wording.

But we want to make progress with the reform of the European Union in a way that does not make the fundamental constitutional issues and that's why we want to achieve our red lines.

Court nixes Patriot Act subpoena
()
7 (UPI) -- A federal judge in New York has ruled that a provision of the Patriot Act allowing the FBI to issue secret subpoenas to Internet service providers and other communications companies is unconstitutional and has ordered the bureau to cease using them.
(7, UPI, New York, the Patriot Act, FBI)
The decision was welcomed by American Civil Liberties Union Executive Director Anthony Romero, who said he was "thrilled" at what he called "yet another setback for the Bush administration's strategy in the war on terror."
(American Civil Liberties Union, Anthony Romero, Bush)
Unless overturned on appeal, the ruling will end one of the FBI's most widely used investigative tools -- and the one that is subject to the least stringent court oversight.
(one, FBI)
U.S. District Court Judge Victor Marrero did not find that the subpoenas, known as National Security Letters, were unconstitutional in themselves.
(U.S., District Court, Victor Marrero, National Security Letters)
But he ruled that provisions of the law that gagged those receiving them from disclosing the fact violated the First Amendment and the separation of powers.
(the First Amendment,)
Since the gag-order provisions could not be meaningfully separated from authority to issue the letters, he struck down the whole law.
()
Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, FBI Director Robert Mueller and bureau General Counsel Valerie Caproni "are hereby enjoined from issuing National Security Letters," often referred to as NSLs, he ordered, staying the implementation of his ruling pending any appeal or for 90 days if there was no appeal.
(Alberto Gonzales, FBI, Robert Mueller, Valerie Caproni, National Security Letters, 90 days)
Department of Justice Spokesman Dean Boyd would say only that government lawyers were "reviewing the ruling and considering our options."
(Department of Justice, Dean Boyd)
A report by the Justice Department's inspector general earlier this year uncovered widespread serious abuse of NSLs, and his investigation -- described in some media reports as relating to possible criminal violations by FBI officials -- is continuing.
(the Justice Department's, earlier this year, FBI)
Thursday's decision is the second victory for the ACLU in a long-running challenge to the power to issue NSLs, launched in 2004 on behalf of a client who -- because of the gag order -- cannot be identified and is referred to in court papers as John Doe.
(Thursday, second, ACLU, 2004, John Doe)
Marrero had previously ruled the letters were unconstitutional in 2004 -- a decision the Justice Department appealed.
(Marrero, 2004, the Justice Department)
But last year, before the appeals court could reach a decision, Congress amended the power to issue NSLs when it re-authorized the Patriot Act.
(last year, Congress, the Patriot Act)
The amended law gave companies served with NSLs -- which require them to turn over information about the electronic communications of their customers -- the right to challenge both the letters themselves and the gag orders associated with them in court.
()
But the standard the courts have to apply under the statute when deciding challenges to the gag orders is far too deferential, Marrero found.
(Marrero,)
The way the statute is worded "eviscerates any meaningful judicial review, as it clearly equates to an uncritical acceptance of the government's insistence of the need for secrecy," he wrote in his 106-page ruling.
(106,)
The law as written "effectively allows the government to determine the constitutionality of its own actions," a breach of the doctrine of the separation of powers.
()
Moreover, given the breadth and longevity of the gag orders, Marrero found, they fail to meet the requirement that restrictions on constitutional rights be drawn as narrowly as possible, and thus breach the First Amendment.
(Marrero, the First Amendment)
The ACLU had argued that its client was prevented by the gag order from taking part in the public discussion about the power to issue NSLs that was part of the debate about congressional renewal of the hurriedly passed suite of anti-terror laws called the Patriot Act.
(ACLU, the Patriot Act)
"In light of the seriousness of the potential intrusion into the individual's personal affairs and the significant possibility of a chilling effect on speech and association -- particularly of expression that is critical of the government or its policies -- a compelling need exists to ensure that the use of NSLs is subject to the safeguards of public accountability, checks and balances, and separation of powers that our Constitution prescribes," Marrero wrote.
(Constitution, Marrero)
Finally, Marrero found that since "Congress intended the statute to function as a secret means of gathering information Â Congress could not have intended Â the provisions authorizing the FBI to issue NSLs Â to operate absent the non-disclosure (or gag) provisions" and thus it was not possible for the court merely to strike down the gag provisions.
(Marrero, Congress, Congress, FBI)
Rather it had to rule that the law as a whole was unconstitutional.
()
The ruling was welcomed by Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., a longtime vocal critic of NSLs.
(Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y.)
In July, Nadler, with support from some GOP lawmakers, introduced a bill that would remove the gag-order provision of the law and provide what his office called in a statement "crucial checks" against the abuse of the letters.
(July, Nadler, GOP)
"Today's decision is a clear signal that Congress must enact changes to the overbroad and unconstitutional NSL authority," Nadler said.
(Today, Congress, NSL, Nadler)
NSLs were first introduced in 1986, but the 2002 Patriot Act lowered the bar for their employment and expanded the kinds of companies that could be served with them -- resulting in an explosion in the numbers that were issued.
(NSLs, 1986, 2002, Patriot Act)
The Justice Department inspector general's report found that the FBI had issued 143,074 NSLs between 2003 and 2005, compared with just 8,500 in 2000.
(The Justice Department, FBI, 143,074, between 2003 and 2005, just 8,500, 2000)
The report also found that the FBI kept no records of criminal referrals made to prosecutors as a result of information it received from NSLs.
(FBI,)
Field offices that responded to the inspector general's request for information about referrals reported just 53 -- 19 for fraud, and 17 each for money-laundering and immigration-related offenses.
(just 53, 19, 17)
The inspector general was only able to confirm a single conviction for a terrorist-related offense on the basis of NSL information.

Feature: Some militants take break
()
7 (UPI) -- An Israeli major last week mistakenly drove into the West Bank town of Jenin, a city even foreign correspondents were warned not to enter in cars bearing Israeli license plates.
(7, UPI, Israeli, last week, West Bank, Jenin, Israeli)
Before long, armed gunmen rushed over and opened fire.
()
In past incidents, soldiers who mistakenly entered Palestinian communities were lynched.
(Palestinian,)
This time, however, a Palestinian policeman went to the officer's aid followed by security men.
(Palestinian,)
They protected him and returned him to Israel without a scratch.
(Israel,)
Their action and readiness to have their pictures published indicated the militants instill less fear now.
()
"You no longer see a masked gunman at every lamppost," said Israeli intelligence Brig. Gen. in the reserves Shalom Harari, who specializes in Palestinian affairs.
(Israeli, Shalom Harari, Palestinian)
When the incident occurred, gunmen belonging to the Fatah Party's al-Aksa Martyrs Brigades were at a security headquarters in town.
(the Fatah Party's, al-Aksa Martyrs Brigades)
They stayed put, fulfilling their part in an agreement with Israel.
(Israel,)
The deal provided that 178 members of the al-Aksa Martyrs Brigades in Jenin and in other West Bank towns surrender their arms to the Palestinian Authority, undertake not to engage in militant activities and stay in PA security compounds for three months.
(178, the al-Aksa Martyrs Brigades in Jenin, West Bank, the Palestinian Authority, three months)
In return, Israel will no longer pursue them.
(Israel,)
It is not an amnesty, and an Israeli official said their past deeds are not forgotten.
(Israeli,)
It is sort of a gentlemen's agreement, though plenty of people here would choke over the idea their counterparts are gentlemen.

Both sides remain suspicious of each another.

A similar understanding that included a plan to co-opt militants into Palestinian security organizations failed several years ago.

Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has long sought to disband militants and create "one authority" and "one gun."

He renewed his effort when Fatah and the Islamic Hamas formed their short-lived national-unity government.

The militants threatened to resist moves to disband them, but eventually changed their minds.

Then, following a meeting with Interior Minister Maj. Gen. Abdul al-Razzaq al-Yahia, a senior official called to say they received no such authorization.

An Israeli defense source who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was discussing intelligence material said Hamas' victory in Gaza scared Fatah's militants.

They knew the Palestinian people were fed up with chaos and lawlessness and that Hamas succeeded in restoring order in Gaza.
(Palestinian, Hamas, Gaza)
The Fatah men feared the Islamic movement might win a showdown in the West Bank as well.
(Fatah, Islamic, the West Bank)
Moreover, they "understood something changed with Abu Mazen," the official continued, referring to Abbas' popular name.
(Abu Mazen, Abbas)
Abu Mazen has been criticized for having lost Gaza to Hamas because he did not give the proper orders to fight Hamas.
(Abu Mazen, Gaza, Hamas, Hamas)
The militants sensed Abbas might be more decisive now "and turn against them."
(Abbas,)
They told Abbas Israel wants to kill them.
(Abbas Israel,)
Who will protect them if they disarm, they asked?

Abbas presented their argument to Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who asked: If we stop pursuing them, will you disband them?
(Abbas, Israeli, Ehud Olmert)
Abbas said he would, the defense source related.

Several militants indicated they were tired of fighting.

(Israel,)
It wants to strengthen Abbas and Prime Minister Salam Fayyad, who oppose violence, seek a compromise with Israel and are competing with the radical Hamas over whose record better serve the Palestinians.
(Abbas, Salam Fayyad, Israel, Hamas, Palestinians)
Moreover, the agreement would fallow Israel to shift intelligence-gathering efforts from Fatah militants to Hamas, the Islamic Jihad and smaller groups bent on continuing the struggle.
(Israel, Fatah, Hamas, the Islamic Jihad)
Rather than send highly trained Special Forces to arrest Fatah militants, it can use them against the other more radical organizations.
(Special Forces, Fatah)
Israel presented a list of people who would qualify for this deal and at a news conference in Ramallah Fayyad said, "The vast majority complied."
(Israel, Ramallah Fayyad)
A German TV correspondent reported a different experience.
(German,)
He told Fayyad he had attended an event in Nablus in which militants gave police their weapons.
(Fayyad, Nablus)
Police then left the room without the arms, the gunmen took their weapons and went away.

Fayyad replied some people did not want to subscribe to the agreement because it did not include their comrades.
(Fayyad,)
Harari estimated only half the people on the list accepted the agreement.
(Harari, only half)
Israeli and Palestinian sources said the PA offered to pay for the arms.

Surrendering arms does not mean the militants who accepted the deal handed over all they had.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Pregnant and breast-feeding women should eat at least 12 ounces of fish and other seafood a week because the benefits for infant brain development outweigh any worries about mercury contamination, a group of U.S. experts said Thursday.
(WASHINGTON, Reuters, at least 12 ounces, U.S., Thursday)
The recommendations contradict U.S. government warnings that these women should consume no more than 12 ounces of fish and other seafood weekly due to concerns that mercury -- which can harm the nervous system of fetuses -- might exist in trace amounts in this food.
(U.S., no more than 12 ounces, weekly)
But the group of 14 obstetricians and nutritionists said the threat of mercury poisoning remains only theoretical, while the warnings have scared many pregnant women into not eating fish at all, robbing them and their babies of vital nutrients like omega-3 fatty acids, known to help brain development.
(14,)
The recommendations were issued in partnership with the National Healthy Mothers, Healthy Babies Coalition, whose members include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Agriculture Department, the March of Dimes, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and others.
(the National Healthy Mothers, Healthy Babies Coalition, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Agriculture Department, the American College of Obstetricians, Gynecologists)
The nutrients in fish and seafood are important for brain and motor skill development in children and can help prevent postpartum depression in mothers, the experts said.
()
The coalition said it received $60,000 from a seafood industry trade group, but the experts defended the independence of their work.
(60,000,)
"There has been no case of fetal mercury toxicity due to fish consumption reported in the United States," said one of the experts, Dr. Ashley Roman, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at New York University Medical Center.
(the United States, one, Ashley Roman, New York University Medical Center)
The group urged that women who want to become pregnant, are pregnant or are breast-feeding should eat a minimum of 12 ounces per week of fish like salmon, tuna, sardines and mackerel and seafood like shrimp, lobster and clams.
(12 ounces,)
That amounts to about two to three servings a week.
(about two to three,)
It did not state a recommended upper limit for consumption.
()
"There are some fish that have been shown to be higher in mercury and in other important trace elements such as shark and swordfish," Roman said.
()
Those might be sources of fish women still might want to stay away from.
()
But the vast majority of fish out there present in the U.S. diet, those are generally very healthy fishes.
(U.S.,)
We're not saying that women should eat 21 meals a week of fish.
(21,)
That's not the message here," added Cornell University nutritionist Thomas Brenna, another member of the group.
(Cornell University, Thomas Brenna)
The experts cited a study published in February in the Lancet medical journal finding that children whose mothers ate more fish and other seafood while pregnant were smarter and had better developmental skills than those whose mothers ate less or none.
(February, Lancet)
It looked at children of 8,000 British women to see how children fared if their mothers ate more than 12 ounces a week.
(8,000, British)
The Food and Drug Administration and Environmental Protection Agency issued advisories in 2001 and 2004 telling women who were pregnant, breast-feeding or trying to become pregnant, as well as young children, to eat no more than 12 ounces weekly of some types of fish due to mercury concerns.
(The Food and Drug Administration and Environmental Protection Agency, 2001, no more than 12 ounces, weekly)
No major studies have shown that mercury from food or vaccines has caused brain damage to mothers or children.
()
"While it's recognized that fish is an important source of protein, especially for pregnant women, this new emphasis on eating more than 12 ounces of fish per week, without mention of the need to avoid mercury-contaminated fish, appears to throw the baby out with the bath water," Michael Bender, director of the Mercury Policy Project advocacy group that believes mercury exposure has damaged children, said in a statement.

Mynamar junta takes soldiers off streets
(Mynamar,)
YANGON (Reuters) - The Myanmar junta reduced security in Yangon sharply on Sunday, apparently confident it would face no further mass protests against military rule, but the streets remained unusually quiet and arrests continued.
(YANGON, Reuters, Myanmar, Yangon, Sunday)
The last barricades were removed from the centre of the former capital around the Shwedagon and Sule pagodas which were the starting and finishing points of protests soldiers crushed by firing into crowds and arresting monks and other demonstrators.
(Shwedagon,)
The few people on the streets said they were still fearful and the Internet, through which dramatic images of the protests and sweeping security force actions to end them reached an outraged world, remained cut off.
()
People on the streets were too scared to talk despite the ruling generals saying for the first time they were willing to talk to detained democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi, albeit on conditions she is unlikely to accept.
(first, Aung San Suu Kyi)
Senior General Than Shwe, the head of the lasted junta in 45 years of unbroken military rule in the former Burma, offered direct talks if Suu Kyi abandoned "confrontation" and her support for sanctions and "utter devastation."
(Than Shwe, 45 years, Burma, Suu Kyi)
Nyan Win, a spokesman for Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy, or NLD, said the offer could open a path to talks about talks.
(Nyan Win, Suu Kyi's, National League for Democracy, NLD)
It is a significant improvement on the past situation.
()
They have never committed themselves to talking to her," he said.
()
Myanmar analysts caution against optimism as hopes of change in the past have been dashed so often, punctuated by the army killing 3,000 people in crushing an uprising in 1988, and state-run newspapers said more people had been arrested.
(Myanmar, 3,000, 1988)
They said on Sunday 78 more people suspected of taking part in mass protests which filled five Yangon city blocks had been picked up for questioning.
(Sunday, five, Yangon)
They said 1,216 people who took part "unknowingly" had been released in the Yangon area after signing pledges not to participate in protests and 398 of the 533 monks taken in monastery raids around the city had been freed.
(1,216, Yangon, 398, 533)
There was no word on the numbers of arrests and releases in other cities where thousands of people were reported to have protested against military rule, but Nyan Win said a senior NLD member was arrested in the second city of Mandalay overnight.
(thousands, Nyan Win, NLD, second, Mandalay, overnight)
Yet, there was a small hope international pressure on the junta to begin talks with the NLD, which won a landslide election victory in 1990 the generals ignored, might be having an impact on a regime that rarely takes notice of the outside world.
(NLD, 1990)
U.N. special envoy Ibrahim Gambari, told reporters on Friday after briefing the Security Council on his four-day visit to Myanmar he saw a "window of opportunity" for talks between the junta and Suu Kyi, who met Gambari twice.
(U.N., Ibrahim Gambari, Friday, the Security Council, four-day, Myanmar, Suu Kyi, Gambari)
"From my own conversation, she appears to be very anxious to have a proper dialogue" provided there were no preconditions, Gambari said.
(Gambari,)
There has been no word from Suu Kyi, 62, who has spent 12 of the past 18 years in detention and is confined to her house in Yangon without a telephone and requiring official permission, granted rarely, to receive visitors.
(Suu Kyi, 62, 12, the past 18 years, Yangon)
But, in what appeared to be another move aimed at deflecting international anger, state television broadcast rare footage of Suu Kyi for the first time in four years on Friday night.
(Suu Kyi, first, four years, Friday, night)
It referred to her respectfully as Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, a departure from past practice when her father's name, Aung San, was dropped to deny her link to the nation's independence hero.
(Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, Aung San)
Britain, France and the United States -- which is pushing for tougher sanctions against the junta -- have circulated a draft statement at the U.N. Security Council that demanded the junta free political detainees and talk to the opposition.
(Britain, France, the United States, the U.N. Security Council)
It would have no legal force, but if a strongly worded statement were approved by China, the closest thing the junta has to an ally, it would send a forceful message to the generals.
(China,)
The junta says 10 people were killed in the crackdown on protests which began with small marches against huge fuel price rises in August and escalated after troops fired over the heads of protesting monks.

EU tackles national governments over air pollution
(EU,)
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union regulators initiated legal action against five member states on Wednesday for having air pollution levels that exceed EU limits and which can cause health problems.
(BRUSSELS, Reuters, five, Wednesday, EU)
The European Commission, the 27-nation bloc's executive, said it was starting legal procedures against Britain, France, Italy, Spain and Slovenia for too-high levels of sulphur dioxide (SO2), a pollutant that can cause breathing difficulties and affect cardiovascular health.
(The European Commission, 27, Britain, France, Italy, Spain, Slovenia)
The Commission also said it was asking 23 national governments to submit information on how they would bring down high levels of polluting air particles, called PM10, to EU-approved standards.

It said in a statement that 70 percent of towns and cities with a population of 250,000 or more in the EU had reported exceeding limits on the particles, which are blamed for causing asthma, heart problems and lung cancer.

"Member states must align themselves with EU standards so that citizens are properly protected," Environment Commissioner Stavros Dimas said in the statement.

Venezuela Congress OKs lifting Chavez term limits

CARACAS (Reuters) - Congress passed President Hugo Chavez's proposal to scrap presidential term limits on Friday in a package of constitutional changes that Venezuelans are likely to approve in a referendum next month.
(Reuters, Congress, Hugo Chavez, Friday, Venezuelans, next month)
Pro-Chavez lawmakers, who dominate the legislature, shouted "yes, yes," and chanted the president's political slogan "Fatherland, socialism or death" in approving the measures.

Polls show many Venezuelans oppose centralizing presidential power but favor sweeteners the socialist leader has included in the package, such as reducing the workday to six hours and giving social security benefits to unregistered taxi drivers.

The opposition, the Roman Catholic Church, university students and rights groups have denounced the scores of proposed changes to the constitution as an authoritarian power grab by a man who has vowed to rule for decades.

Protests against the proposal have turned violent.

Wall Street is concerned that the package will further chill investment, especially after the anti-U.S. president decreed a raft of nationalizations earlier this year with the vow of making the major oil exporter a socialist state.
(earlier this year,)
The package also would strip the central bank of its autonomy, give Chavez control over international reserves, empower authorities to detain citizens without charge and open the way to censoring the media in so-called political emergencies.
(Chavez,)
In speech after speech, Chavez's supporters in Congress said the package addressed the needs of poor people that governments before Chavez had neglected for decades.

But the proposal has caused a rare rift in official ranks.

Still, government officials are working to mobilize Chavez supporters because of worries abstention could be high.

Australian mortgage belt voters look for change
(Australian,)
ADELAIDE (Reuters) - In Australia's most marginal electorate, rising home loan interest rates have put voters in the mood for a change of government at general elections on November 24.
(ADELAIDE, Reuters, Australia, November 24)
National opinion polls put conservative Prime Minister John Howard well behind his Labor rival Kevin Rudd, with the central bank's decision to increase interest rates on Wednesday further hurting Howard's campaign focus on economic management.
(John Howard, Labor, Kevin Rudd, Wednesday, Howard)
The anti-Howard mood is evident in Kingston, the most marginal government-held seat, in the state of South Australia.
(Kingston, South Australia)
Set in Adelaide's sprawling far southern suburbs, Kingston is full of young families and mortgage holders who are bracing for higher loan repayments.
(Kingston,)
"It's time for a change, because things just aren't working the way they are," Andrew Pidgeon, who grew up in Kingston's southern beachside suburbs, told Reuters at Port Noarlunga.
(Andrew Pidgeon, Kingston, Reuters, Port Noarlunga)
Howard, now 68, has been in power for nearly 12 years and has won four straight elections, the latest in 2004 by promising to keep home loan interest rates at record lows.
(Howard, 68, nearly 12 years, four, 2004)
But the central bank has lifted rates six times since then, each time by 0.25 percentage points, with economists expecting more hikes to come, undermining Howard's usual electoral advantage on economic management.
(six, 0.25, Howard)
Pidgeon, his wife Fiona and one-month-old baby daughter are now looking at the prospect of higher mortgage repayments for their suburban home, but they remain optimistic.

"If we manage our money well, we should be able to manage," he told Reuters, adding he saw little real difference between the government and Labor, who have both offered A$34 billion in tax cuts and promised conservative economic management.
(Reuters, Labor, A$34 billion)
Interest rates are a sensitive political issue in Australia, where home ownership is a national aspiration and where one in three voters are paying off a mortgage.
(Australia, one, three)
But a booming real estate market and rising interest rates have helped push housing affordability to record lows, with average first home buyers needing to commit more than 31 percent of their income to cover their mortgage.
(first, more than 31 percent)
A housing lobby group, Australians for Affordable Housing, says the latest interest rate rise will mean 100,000 extra people will now be struggling to meet their repayments.
(Australians, Affordable Housing, 100,000)
People paying off mortgages in marginal seats, in the outer suburbs of the nation's cities, have been the key to Howard's continued electoral success.
(Howard,)
But the polls suggest those voters, known as the "Howard Battlers," now want a change.
(Howard Battlers,)
Howard defended the government's economic management on Thursday, and played down the impact of the latest rate rise, saying his planned tax cuts would more than compensate for higher mortgage payments.
(Howard, Thursday)
"The tax cuts to which we are committed ... are worth about A$120 a month," he said, while extra mortgage repayments would be worth about A$40 to A$50 a month.
(about A$120, about A$40 to A$50)
In Kingston, Labor needs to pick up about 200 extra votes to win the seat, which the government holds by 0.1 percent.
(Kingston, Labor, about 200, 0.1 percent)
Kingston includes areas once considered rural, including the McLaren Vale wine region, Australia's first legal beach for nude bathing, and Port Noarlunga, last stop on the suburban rail network.

Kingston also has one of Australia's highest levels of homebuyers, with 45 percent of people paying off home loans.

BRCA genes raise breast cancer risk for men too
()
NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes that increase the risk of breast cancer for women also do the same in men.
(NEW YORK, Reuters Health, BRCA2)
Men can develop breast cancer, although they account for only about 1 percent of breast cancer cases.
(only about 1 percent,)
Previous studies have shown that men who carry mutations in the BRCA2 gene are at greater risk of developing breast cancer than men in the general population.
(BRCA2,)
Now, new research suggests that the same is true for men with BRCA1 mutations.
(BRCA1,)
Dr. Sining Chen from Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland, and colleagues studied data on 1,939 families that included 97 male patients with breast cancer.
(Sining Chen, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, 1,939, 97)
"At all ages, the cumulative risks of male breast cancer were higher in both BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers than in noncarriers," the researchers report in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.
(all ages, BRCA1, BRCA2, the Journal of the National Cancer Institute)
The likelihood of developing breast cancer was highest for men in their 30s and 40s and decreased with increasing age.

For example, for BRCA2 mutation carriers, 30-year-old men were 22 times more likely to develop breast cancer than carriers at 70 years of age.
(BRCA2, 30-year-old, 22, 70 years of age)
The risk was higher for BRCA2 than BRCA1 mutation carriers.

The investigators calculate that, by age 70, the chances of developing breast cancer are 1.2 percent for male BRCA1 mutation carriers and 6.8 percent for men with the BRCA2 mutation.
(age 70, 1.2 percent, BRCA1, 6.8 percent, BRCA2)
They point out that these estimates of risk are "important for determining appropriate risk management strategies" for male members of families with mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2.

Since launching the franchise in late 2003, i9 Sports boasts over 100,000 members in 25 states with kids participating in leagues and camps in the most popular team sports such as Flag Football, Soccer, and Basketball.
(late 2003, i9 Sports, 100,000, 25, Flag Football, Basketball)
According to company Founder & CEO Frank V. Fiume, "The success of i9 Sports starts with the great passion people have for sports and the desire to make a positive impact on kids.
(Founder & CEO, Frank V. Fiume, i9 Sports)
Opening our 100th franchise location is a very special milestone in the industry.
(100th,)
According to a 2006 International Franchise Association (IFA) study, less than half of all franchisors ever achieve 100 franchise units.
(2006, IFA, less than half, 100)
However, as Fiume points out, "It comes with tremendous responsibility for his organization in selecting the right candidate.
()
It is crucial that we carefully screen potential i9 Sports franchise owners and award franchises, not sell to anyone who wants one.
()
Although it is quite an accomplishment for any franchisor to have 100 franchise locations, it is especially rewarding for us because of our selection process.
(100,)
The latest i9 Sports franchise was purchased by Jeff and Katie Kraft in Chesterfield County, Virginia.
(Jeff, Katie Kraft, Chesterfield County, Virginia)
The Kraft's total initial investment was approximately $60,000 in exchange for the rights to operating the i9 Sports name with 10 youth sports in a protected 350,000-population territory.
(Kraft, approximately $60,000, i9 Sports, 10, 350,000)
This also includes classroom and field training, on-going support, equipment and supplies, proprietary software, custom website, a marketing game plan focused on increasing brand awareness, and bulk volume discounts on everything from insurance to jerseys.
()
While the company has gained trademark approval in 31 countries with the objective of becoming an international youth sports franchise brand over the next 4 years, it plans on opening another 80 to 100 franchises in the U.S. over the next 24 months.
(31, the next 4 years, 80 to 100, U.S., the next 24 months)

()
A segment of companies are pursuing the objective of making Internet search as comprehensive as possible, but others are looking for more valuable ways to refine assortments and help deliver more valuable, personalized results.
()
In addition, with the Business Console, business users can monitor customer reviews generated by Web 2.0 tools which are dominating the shopping landscape.
(2.0,)
As consumers become more comfortable using the Internet for information created by other consumers they, too, begin to create content in the form of blogs, podcasts, and tags.
()
The ability to quickly detect positive and negative sentiment and react accordingly can make or break any business.
()
"The Business Console puts the power of IDOL's advanced capabilities in the hands of business users to help companies deliver a superior user experience and to differentiate and excel in today's competitive e-Commerce environments," said Mike Lynch, CEO of Autonomy.
(IDOL, today, Mike Lynch, Autonomy)
The ability to understand online shoppers' needs, quickly deliver the right product and respond immediately to shifting intentions and preferences are vital to the success of an e-commerce site.
()
The Autonomy Business Console also offers:

Advantest Introduces Highly Accurate 2Gbps Test Solution for Source- Synchronous Bi-Directional Interfaces; Broadens Range of Solutions for Open- Architecture T2000 Test Platform
(Synchronous Bi-Directional Interfaces,)
SANTA CLARA, Calif., Oct. 22 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Advantest Corporation (TSE: 6857, NYSE: ATE) today is announcing its new 2Gbps source synchronous (1) interface test solution, which offers high-accuracy testing for source-synchronous interfaces such as DDR2/DDR3 which are found in most CPUs and memory chipsets.
(SANTA CLARA, Calif., Oct. 22, Advantest Corporation, 6857, NYSE, today, 2Gbps, 1)
Advantest's new 2Gbps Digital Module (2GDM) test solution, a complete functional/AC/DC test solution for the company's T2000 open-architecture test system, features very high performance at low cost.
(Advantest, 2Gbps, Digital Module, 2GDM)
The high-density test module provides a total of 36 Input/Output (I/O) channels, each with digital drive, digital compare, and an additional FlyBy (2) compare channel, along with DC and frequency measurement capabilities.
(36, Input/Output, 2, DC)
Its unique edge shift and patented Advantest multi-strobe capabilities significantly speed timing margin testing providing for single pass testing of most source-synchronous and timing parameters.
(Advantest,)
The new module addresses the industry's need for an SoC tester that can perform high-throughput at-speed functional test on source- synchronous interfaces.
()
Meets Changing Market and Technology Needs
()
Growing market demand for multimedia (video, music, online games) personal computers means that CPU and memory data processing capacity of semiconductors must also become more advanced.
()
Particularly in the memory field, because of Microsoft's recently introduced Windows Vista (R), a shift is expected from DDR2 to DDR3, the latest generation offering fast processing speeds and larger capacity.
(Microsoft, Windows Vista)
This technology requires source-synchronous interfaces, which enable high-speed data transfer between the CPU and memory devices.
(CPU,)
Testing these interfaces on traditional SoC test systems carries significant added test costs, because without the FlyBy comparators available on the 2GDM, two tester channels are required per DUT pin.
(2GDM, two, DUT)
Additionally, confirming the timing margins on these source-synchronous interfaces requires that the tester pin-electronics track the DUT output clock and perform timing measurements relative to its timing.
(DUT,)
The 2GDM is unique in the industry as it performs this task within a single test pass, using patented Advantest technology.
(2GDM, Advantest)
New Product Meets New Needs for Performance, As Well As For Cost
()
The new 2GDM enables full functional testing of high-speed source- synchronous interfaces up to a speed of 2Gbps on the T2000 OPENSTAR (R) standard-based test platform, with high accuracy, low cost and overall reliability that sets a new level of performance.
(2GDM, 2Gbps)
Features and Benefits * The industry's first testing solution to support source-synchronous testing with the use of multi-strobe technology.
(Benefits, first)
Advantest's patented multi-strobe, which enables real-time testing of high-speed source- synchronous interfaces, dramatically simplifies test setup and reduces device test time. * The 2GDM supports test speeds up to 2Gbps to keep pace with high-speed data transfer requirements for DDR2/DDR3 interface testing. * Each of the 36 channels on the 2GDM provides a secondary compare channel which allows the module to test bi-directional I/O busses with a zero round-trip delay.
(Advantest, 2GDM, 2Gbps, 36, 2GDM, zero)
This effectively nullifies the impact of the signal delays through the interconnect and performance board.
()
An integrated zero round-trip solution provides the user a simpler test setup environment as well as much lower cost. * It expands the range of tests that can be performed on a single SoC test system, Advantest's T2000, extending and enhancing ROI.
(zero, Advantest)
The 2Gbps not only enables real-time testing of high-speed source-synchronous interfaces on an SoC test system, but it expands the capabilities of the T2000 non-proprietary test platform.
(2Gbps,)
The new module is part of a suite of SoC test solutions for Advantest's T2000, which also includes higher speeds (up to 6.5Gbps), higher density (up to 128 cost effective channels per module), higher power, mixed signal, and RF testing capabilities (see 12GWSGA RF module release dated 10/28/07).
(Advantest, 128, RF, 12GWSGA, RF, 10/28/07)
The 2GDM adds cost effective testing of bi-directional source-synchronous interfaces to the offerings.
(2GDM,)
Advantest's 2Gbps Digital Module will be available in January, 2008.
(Advantest, 2Gbps, Digital Module, January, 2008)

Does fining parents really work?
()
Three-quarters of people think it is right for parents to face fines for serious misbehaviour by their children, a poll for FiveLive Report shows.
(Three-quarters, FiveLive Report)
More than a third (38%) told ICM Research they should face prison.
(More than a third, 38%, ICM Research)
But does punishing parents actually work?
()
One of the areas in which parents most commonly face criminal action is for non attendance of their children at school.
(One,)
Figures published in the past week show that more than 23,000 notices have so far been issued by local authorities.
(the past week, more than 23,000)
But Ming Zhang, principle education officer at Kingston upon Thames Council has investigated the use of penalty notices to punish non-attendance.
(Ming Zhang, Kingston upon Thames Council)
He says he has found no link between fining parents and school attendance.
()
He said: "In order for penalty notices to have an impact there must be some sort of correlation but my research indicated there isn't such a correlation which means penalty notices have no impact on school attendance.
()
A penalty notice is a sort of last resort.
()
It's not preventative, it's reactive.
()
He says supportive measures like parenting classes are more effective in getting parents back to school but that is more expensive.
()
It's easier to fine parents or take them to court.
()
Professor John Howson who runs Education Data Surveys agrees: "It's a cheap option but there's not much evidence they get children back to school."
(John Howson,)
He has found massive variations across the country.
()
He said: "Some local authorities scattered them like confetti and didn't seem to bother if they were paid and others hardly seemed to use them at all.
()
We were surprised to find that two-thirds of fines were unpaid - this was much higher than unpaid for court fines where 85-90% are collected.
(two-thirds, 85-90%)
If you're not going to enforce a penalty its pointless using it.
()
Ineffective deterrent
()
Tracey was fined £450 for her son and daughter skipping school.
(450,)
She was also given a 12-month parenting order and faces jail if her children continue to truant.
(12-month,)
She says fines haven't helped.
()
Her daughter's gone back to school and her son's out of control.
()
She said: "It's not a deterrent at all being fined.
()
Kids don't learn anything from that, they know we'll pay for it so what are they going to learn?
()
It's not made them dramatically change or that they're upset over it.
()
They find it hilarious reading about themselves in papers, their friends are the same with them.
()
If my children continue to truant as they have been doing I'll be taken back to court and it'll be a more serious thing then, not just a slap on wrist and little fine - it'll be where I could face prison then what'll happen to the children?
()
Maybe they will take them off me then.
()
It's not just Tracey who says it doesn't work.
()
Other parents argue fines don't change their kids' behaviour.
()
For instance, Jane is a mother of five who was fined £100.
(Jane, five, 100)
Her eldest son was violent towards her, stole from her, had dyslexia and other behavioural problems and refused to go to school.
()
She says the family didn't get enough support from the school or her local council.
()
Jane knew she was struggling and looked for help.
(Jane,)
She went to parenting classes run by the Life Education Centre charity.
(the Life Education Centre,)
They really helped her dealing with her other four kids but she said fining her for her son's misbehaviour just meant the rest of the family paid the price.
(four,)
When he leaves my door and goes for the bus there's nothing more I can do and they said: 'You've got to make sure he's on that bus'.
()
But I've got other children to take to school - he's old enough to take himself.
()
My other children aren't.
()
It just put a financial strain on us as a family - my partner was living here at the time and he was working and we couldn't pay it in one go, we paid it weekly, but that was money out of the budget, because no matter if you're working or if you're on benefits you've got a small budget so it just put a financial strain on me, I had to jiggle the shopping, cut back by about £10 a week it was I had to pay.
(weekly, about £10)
It was awful.
()
Parenting classes
()
The Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF) believes fines serve a useful purpose, but are not the only option.
(The Department for Children, Schools and Families,)
Children's Minister Kevin Brennan said: "We believe penalty notices are an important tool for local authorities, but should only be used as a last resort in cases where parents are persistently and flagrantly failing in their duties.
(Kevin Brennan,)
The bottom line is we want schools and parents to establish a united front against indiscipline.
()
No parent should be fined if they are doing their utmost and local authorities should provide them with the support they need to get their child back on track.
()
But we make no apologies for getting tough on the minority of parents who are obstructive or negligent in the face of poor behaviour.
()
Fines are a helpful deterrent that can drive these parents to positive action - but of course the best outcome for everyone is that they are simply not needed at all.
()
One of the local authorities which has been most enthusiastic about using penalty notices is Liverpool.
(One, Liverpool)
Ron Collinson, lead attendance officer a Liverpool city council says the notices are only one of a number of tools used to improve attendance.
(Ron Collinson, Liverpool city council)
The authority also works with schools to improve their management of pupil attendance.
()
The council also run support programmes for parents including parenting classes.
()
And they are just appointing 20 parent support workers.
(20,)
"They may for instance go to the home in the morning, help the mother get kids out to school," says Collinson.
(Collinson,)
The authority also works with police, finding out what the barriers are to attendance, for instance if kids don't feel safe coming to school.
()
But he says the penalty notices can work well as "an early intervention strategy."
()

Despite the rigours of performing, the Manchester-born singer - who gained cult status as the brooding frontman of The Smiths in the 1980s - has still found time to write a ninth solo album.

He said his new LP would certainly draw from his experiences on the road but would still remain a personal piece of work.

"You are bound to pick up influences whose lyrics are famed for incorporating social and political commentary," he said.

But when you create and write it's very important to be yourself and that's what I've always tried to do.

UK firms 'raise CO2 transparency'
(UK,)
Significant milestone
()
Compiled by environmental research organisation Trucost, the CDP is backed by a group of 315 of the world's largest investment houses with $41 trillion under management - equivalent to three times the annual economic output of the US.
(Trucost, CDP, 315, $41 trillion, three, US)
FTSE 350 companies were asked how much carbon dioxide (CO2) they produced both directly and indirectly - for example in the production of electricity they buy.
(350,)
These emissions totalled more than 563 million tonnes of CO2.
(more than 563 million tonnes,)
But this did not include emissions from supply chains which would make up the bulk of the carbon footprint of most firms and often occurs overseas, CDP said.
(CDP,)
A number of large firms - including Tesco, Unilever, Imperial Tobacco and Cadbury Schweppes - are now working with CDP and their suppliers to find a uniform way of measuring these emissions.
(Tesco, Unilever, Imperial Tobacco, Cadbury Schweppes, CDP)
"These collaborations mark a very significant milestone in corporate action to mitigate climate change," CDP chief executive Paul Dickinson said.
(CDP, Paul Dickinson)
By engaging their supply chains, companies will encourage suppliers to measure and manage their greenhouse gas emissions, and ultimately reduce the total carbon footprint of their indirect emissions.
()
For many companies it is the supply chain that makes up the vast majority of their emissions, so this initiative is vital in helping them reduce their total carbon footprint.
()
Positive message
()
The CDP report was launched five years ago to encourage disclosure from companies about carbon emissions, allowing investors to make informed decisions about where they put their money.
(CDP, five years ago)
Analysts have argued that as global warming becomes a bigger concern, a company's share price will increasingly be impacted by its environmental performance.
()
Climate Change Minister Joan Ruddock said that more investors must give consideration to environmental and social credentials in making investment decisions.
(Joan Ruddock,)
Investors should ... send out signals to the financial markets to say that carbon disclosure is vital and show companies that it will affect their investment decisions.
()
Together we must work to drive down emissions," she said.
()
Mr Dickinson added that UK firms were "leading" the way when it came to disclosing their greenhouse gas emissions, compared with overseas firms.
(UK,)
"This sends out a positive message that UK companies are taking steps to understand the risks and opportunities that climate change presents to their business and recognising the importance of disclosure on the issue," he added.
(UK,)
The increasingly important value investors put on a firm's approach to climate change meant "the pressure is increasing on companies to respond," he said.
()
The CDP report also said that 87% of the firms which responded felt that climate change posed a commercial risk, with 38% saying that they had implemented projects to reduce emissions.

Armenian sway over US lawmakers
(Armenian, US)
Despite a direct appeal by US President George W Bush, lawmakers in the US have backed a description of the mass killings of Armenians by Ottoman Turks after 1915 as genocide.
(US, George W Bush, US, Armenians, Ottoman Turks, 1915)
While Armenia welcomed the vote by a panel in the US House of Representatives, Turkey condemned it as "unacceptable" and has recalled its ambassador to Washington for "consultations."
(Armenia, the US House of Representatives, Turkey, Washington)
Turkey accepts there were mass killings in 1915-17 but denies it was genocide.
(Turkey, 1915-17)
Ahead of the vote, senior administration officials warned that if the resolution passed, Turkey could cut access to military bases needed for US operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.
(Turkey, US, Iraq, Afghanistan)
Its passage "would do great harm to our relations with a key ally in Nato and in the global war on terror," Mr Bush said from the White House Rose Garden.

Nonetheless, the non-binding resolution passed the House Foreign Affairs Committee by 27 to 21, a first step towards holding a full vote in the House of Representatives.
(the House Foreign Affairs Committee, 27, 21, first, the House of Representatives)
Given that Armenians represent only about 1.5m of America's 300m population, what has won them such influence over the US Congress - and perhaps the nation's foreign policy?
(Armenians, only about 1.5, America, 300, US, Congress)
Organised lobby
()
Part of the answer lies in the organisation and determination of the Armenian-American lobby groups, says Dr Svante Cornell, of the Central Asia-Caucasus Institute at Johns Hopkins University.
(Armenian, Dr Svante Cornell, the Central Asia-Caucasus Institute, Johns Hopkins University)
The Armenian National Committee of America (ANCA) and the Armenian Assembly of America (AAA) are among the most powerful.
(The Armenian National Committee of America, the Armenian Assembly of America, AAA)
Another factor is that the Armenian-American community is largely concentrated in important states such as California, Michigan and Massachusetts, Dr Cornell said.
(Armenian, California, Michigan, Massachusetts, Cornell)
"You have basically a number of places where the Armenian issue is very important in local politics - especially for anybody wanting to get elected in California," he said.
(Armenian, California)
The Turkish lobby is much less organised and much less rooted in an electorate than the Armenian lobby.
(Turkish, Armenian)
Wednesday's resolution was written by Democratic Representative Adam Schiff, whose California district is home to the country's largest ethnic-Armenian community.
(Wednesday, Democratic, Adam Schiff, California, Armenian)
'Sobering' choice

Of course, the vote - both for and against - was also based on representatives' competing sets of principles.

Opening the debate, Tom Lantos, the committee's Democrat chairman, acknowledged that the resolution posed a "sobering" choice.

Divisions within the committee ultimately crossed party lines, with eight Democrats voting against the measure and eight Republicans voting for it.

Opponents of the resolution argue it could endanger US national security and that now is not the time to have the debate.

The AAA has worked very closely with the sponsors and co-sponsors of the resolution, he said, as well as talking to members of Congress from both parties about the issue.

The close-knit Armenian-American diaspora has also been at work educating other communities and writing to politicians, Mr Ardouny said.

"The response has been great in terms of activism throughout the entire Armenian-American community," he said.

My grandparents were genocide survivors - they came to this country, they got an education, they became part of the American fabric.

Migrants 'one eighth of workers'
(one eighth,)
The report into the economic impact of immigration draws together a comprehensive range of research from across government and the academic world.

It quotes official labour market statistics which reveal that in the final quarter of 2006 people born overseas accounted for 12.5% of the working age population - up from 7.4% a decade earlier.
(the final quarter of 2006, 12.5%, 7.4%, a decade earlier)
Migration added 0.5% a year to the working age population between 2001 and 2006, the report says.

Productivity
()
The report also says that on average migrants earn more than UK-born workers, and are thought to be more productive.
(UK,)
But migration has had no significant impact on the unemployment rates of British citizens, it says.
(British,)
According to Treasury figures in the report, migration contributed around £6bn to output growth in 2006.
(Treasury, £6bn, 2006)
However, the report admits it is difficult to assess immigration's effect on GDP (gross domestic product) per head - one measure of the size of the economy.

The paper prepared for the Lords Select Committee on Economic Affairs says evidence suggests immigration had a slightly positive effect on wages - but that there were "very modest negative effects" for the lowest-paid unskilled workers.

In response, an assembly government spokesperson said: "We've always said that holding a referendum would depend on public support being there for further powers for the assembly.

Peter Hain is entitled to his views, just like anyone else, about where public opinion will be on this during the remainder of this term.
(Peter Hain,)
Plaid MEP Jill Evans said the One Wales agreement "clearly states that a referendum on a full parliament will be held during this term."
(Jill Evans, One)
She said Mr Hain was "obviously picking a fight with Rhodri Morgan and the One Wales government," and asked whether he was trying to increase his support among Labour MPs or "planning to be a road block against the policies of the assembly government."
(Rhodri Morgan, One, Labour)
Mr Hain also criticised Conservative proposals to allow only English MPs to vote on English matters in the wake of devolution.
(Hain, Conservative, English, English)
"So we have an English nationalist party flying under the Conservative flag, a Welsh nationalist party (Plaid Cymru) and a Scottish Nationalist Party (SNP)," he said.

Labour is the only party that believes in the unity of the United Kingdom.

Dai Davies, the independent MP for Blaenau Gwent, has called for a cut in the number of Welsh MPs from 40 to 22 to reflect the growing influence of the assembly.
(Dai Davies, Blaenau Gwent, Welsh, 40 to 22)
Mr Davies said a huge amount of public money was being spent on MPs when "a significant amount of business, even now, has nothing to do with our constituencies or Wales in general.
(Wales,)
So we must be realistic in how we spend public money.
()
Counter-productive and crazy
()
But Mr Hain responded: "I cannot understand why we want fewer Welsh MPs of whatever party to fly the Welsh flag in parliament, to decide our Welsh budget, to decide our position on a whole series of crucial issues.
(Hain, Welsh, Welsh)
The Conservatives, now the independent MP Dai Davies, [and] the nationalists, they all want to short-change Wales by having Wales's clout at Westminster reduced.
(Conservatives, Dai Davies, Wales, Wales, Westminster)
That's a very counter-productive and crazy policy to pursue if you're interested in a strong Wales.
(Wales,)
On another issue, the possibility that the assembly government might try to outlaw smacking of children, Mr Hain said criminalising parents who gave their child "a small tap" was very worrying.
(Hain,)
The idea was ruled out last week by the UK government in both Wales and England, and Mr Hain said the idea that Wales could go ahead with it had "come out of nowhere."
(last week, UK, Wales, England, Hain, Wales)
He said First Minister Rhodri Morgan had not discussed it with him, Welsh Labour had no policy on the idea, and added: "People would need to consult and think this through."

To take just one example: YouGov polls (not random samples of the British public, but drawn from a panel of internet users) went from an 11% Labour lead at the end of the party's conference to a 3% Conservative lead one week later at the close of that party's conference.

English tests for trainee lawyers

The report's author, Lord Neuberger of Abbotsbury, said the profession has work to do if it is to improve access to the Bar for students from different ethnic and socio-economic backgrounds.
(Neuberger, Abbotsbury)
Significant disincentives
()
"There is a perception that the Bar is only open to the more privileged," he wrote.
(Bar,)
Many from less fortunate backgrounds are put off from even considering a career at the Bar.
(Bar,)
In his report, Lord Neuberger raises the possibility of a standardised entry exam for the Bar Vocational Course (BVC).
(Neuberger, BVC)
The course is a post-graduate requirement for all potential barristers and the report found that "most, if not all" schools offering it accept students without sufficient English skills.
(English,)
Entry to the course is currently based on undergraduate grades.
()
The recommendations form part of 57 made in the report, carried out in consultation with representatives from across the profession as well as lay people.
(57,)
The report states that access based solely on merit is hampered by the £13,000 cost of participating in a BVC, given that successful completion does not guarantee a "pupillage," or barrister traineeship.
(13,000, BVC)
As it stands, there are more applicants than pupillage places available.
()
"The cost and the risk of entry procedures and training represent further significant disincentives, particularly to those who are less financially well-off and socially advantaged," the report states.
()
Lord Neuberger called for government, legal chambers and other employers who rely on a steady supply of qualified barristers to pool their resources and create more places to train successful BVC students.
(Neuberger, BVC)
He also urged more part-time pupillages be arranged.

His recommendations also include plans for a national curriculum-based introduction to the legal profession and a school placement scheme.

Turkana Boy, considered the most complete early human fossil, is being removed from his bomb-proof vault to take centre stage at an exhibition that curators say will provide the most complete record of the evolution of Man.
(Turkana Boy,)
However, the collection, to be show-cased for the first time at the Nairobi National Museum after a £5 million renovation financed by the European Union, has drawn sharp criticism from evangelical Christians who deny the theory of evolution.
(first, the Nairobi National Museum, £5 million, the European Union, Christians)
They, in turn, are being opposed vociferously by scientists eager to study the specimens and to explore the role of Kenya as the cradle of humankind.
(Kenya,)
Bishop Boniface Adoyo, the head of the 35 Kenyan evangelical denominations, is leading opposition to the exhibition.
(Bishop Boniface Adoyo, 35, Kenyan)
"I do not dispute that as humans we have a history, but my family most certainly did not descend from the apes," he said.
()
The bishop was invited to view the new Human Origins gallery before it opened this month, and said that he would call on his flock to demonstrate outside the museum if evolution was described as anything other than merely a theory.
(Human Origins, this month)
"Bits of it are being disproved by scientists every day," he said.
()
Yet it's being taught in our schools to children - a theory being taught as fact.
()
His argument echoes a similar dispute in America, where creationists have developed the theory of intelligent design as a rival to Darwin's natural selection.
(America, Darwin)
Among the exhibits at the museum are remains of primitive apes dating back 25 million years and evidence that primates have been walking upright for 4 million years.
(25 million years, 4 million years)
The star of the show will be Turkana Boy, a 5ft 3in (1.62m) skeleton of a human who died 1.5 million years ago, aged about 12.
(Turkana Boy, 5ft 3, 1.62m, 1.5 million years ago, about 12)
It is the best-preserved example of Homo erectus, the species that set out from Africa to conquer the world.

Lining up against the evangelical movement is the country's most famous fossil-hunting family.
()
Richard Leakey, who led the team that unearthed the skeleton in the far north in 1984, dismissed the creationist argument.
(Richard Leakey, 1984)
He said: "Science is at the very foundation of our ability to deal with the new century, so if we bring it down to the idea that science may be unChristian . . . well, how stupid can you get?"
(the new century,)
Much of the museum's collection is based on finds made by his parents, Louis and Mary Leakey, in the 1920s.
(Louis and Mary Leakey, the 1920s)
Dr Leakey has his own concerns about displaying the skeleton, arguing that it would prevent access for scientists, who still have a lot to learn from Turkana Boy.
(Turkana Boy,)
Fredrick Manthi, senior research scientist at the museum, said that he had no problem reconciling evolution with his Christian faith.
(Fredrick Manthi, Christian)
The gallery, he added, was an attempt to show the world that Kenya could be considered the birthplace of humanity.

FRIENDS of Kate and Gerry McCann have been told to prepare to be made official suspects as they face further questioning by the Portuguese police.
(FRIENDS of Kate, Gerry McCann, Portuguese)
Detectives want to clarify a series of inconsistencies in the statements of seven friends who were dining with the McCanns on the evening of the disappearance of Madeleine McCann.
(seven, the evening, Madeleine McCann)
Their lawyers have now warned them that they may be "arguidos," or suspects.

"It would be a procedural matter, so that they could ask them more probing questions," said a source close to the legal team.

According to the source, independent tests conducted on behalf of the McCanns have found the DNA "does not conclusively match Madeleine's."

The source said: "We are happy that the results are supportive of our assertion."

Last week it was claimed that detectives were focusing on three "windows of opportunity" directly linked to the McCanns" movements before and during dinner on the evening of May 3, suggesting police remain convinced they were involved in their daughter's death.

Alipio Ribeiro, national director of the Policia Judiciaria, said last month that formal letters requesting interviews with the friends of the McCanns had been drawn up.

O'Brien was away from the table for at least 15 minutes and Kate McCann discovered that her daughter was missing 10 minutes later.

run that killed child and maimed mother
()
A "MANIAC" hit-and-run driver who killed a four-year-old girl and seriously injured her mother while high on drugs was jailed for 13 years yesterday.
(four-year-old, 13 years yesterday)
Daniel Jackson, 31, drove his 4x4 along an Edinburgh pavement, hitting Rachel Donachie and her daughter, Olivia, as they walked home from nursery.
(Daniel Jackson, 31, 4x4, Rachel Donachie, Olivia)
The girl was killed instantly at the scene, just yards from the family's home in Redford Drive, Colinton.
(Redford Drive, Colinton)
Her 33-year-old mother later had her left leg amputated below the knee as a result of the injuries she suffered.
(33-year-old,)
Jackson, a married father of three, who has a string of previous convictions including crimes of violence, last month admitted the culpable homicide of Olivia on 30 May.
(Jackson, three, last month, Olivia, 30 May)
At the High Court in Glasgow yesterday he was also banned from driving for life.
(the High Court, Glasgow, yesterday)
Jackson sat motionless in the dock with his head bowed as the sentence was read out.
(Jackson,)
Judge Lord Menzies asked him: "What possessed you to do the awful things you did on 30 May, 2007 in the quiet residential streets of Colinton, Edinburgh?
(Menzies, 30 May, 2007, Colinton, Edinburgh)
You drove your Jeep in a furious, dangerous and wholly irresponsible manner, apparently without any thought or consideration for the safety of pedestrians or other road users.
(Jeep,)
He continued: "It is little wonder that several onlookers described you as driving as if you were being chased by the police, and that you were driving like a maniac.
()
You were driving like a maniac.
()
The judge told Jackson that if he was convicted after a trial, instead of pleading guilty, he would have received a 16-year prison sentence.
(Jackson, 16-year)
The High Court in Edinburgh earlier heard that Jackson had taken Valium and methadone on the day in question and claimed to have taken heroin and 20-30 Valium tablets the previous night.
(The High Court, Edinburgh, Jackson, Valium, the day, 20-30, Valium, the previous night)
The court also heard that there were 11 defects on Jackson's Jeep Cherokee, rendering it unsafe to drive.
(11, Jackson's, Jeep, Cherokee)
This included having no working foot brakes.
()
Dorothy Bain, the advocate-depute, said Jackson was driving at about 40mph when the accident happened, adding that tradesmen working on a nearby house described the sound of the crash as being "like a bomb going off."
(Dorothy Bain, Jackson, about 40mph)
Jackson, from the Grassmarket area of the capital, left the scene of the fatal collision.
(Jackson,)
But he later turned up at a hospital in Edinburgh, having slashed his wrists and told doctors: "I killed a little girl."
(Edinburgh,)
He was taken to the city's St Leonard's police station, where he said: "I deserve life for what I've done, a life for a life."
(St Leonard's,)
He told officers who interviewed him that on the day of the death he had just been "posing" and driving around.
()
The court heard that Jackson had already caused another crash in which a woman at a bus stop was injured before the fatality.
(Jackson,)
Gordon Jackson, QC, said in mitigation that Jackson was "extremely remorseful" for his actions.
(Gordon Jackson, QC, Jackson)
He pointed out that Jackson had not immediately run away from the scene of the crash, and had initially tried to call the police before leaving.
(Jackson,)
He also said Jackson had not been driving illegally, and had a licence, insurance and an MoT certificate.
(Jackson, MoT)
But Lord Menzies told Jackson he should never have considered driving the vehicle, which was a "death trap."
(Menzies, Jackson)
"This car was not just slightly dangerous," Lord Menzies said.
(Menzies,)
The vehicle examiner was of the opinion that it was the worst car he had ever examined in his ten years' experience.
(ten years',)
The judge added: "The hearts of all right-thinking members of society must surely go out to the whole Donachie family for the terrible wrongs which you have inflicted on them."
(Donachie,)
A statement read out on behalf of Paul Donachie, 39, Olivia's father, outside court said he hoped the sentence would act as a deterrent.
(Paul Donachie, 39, Olivia)
He said: "I can only hope that this sentence helps deter other drivers who may otherwise choose to drive in such a reckless way, or while under the influence of drugs."
()
The court was told Mrs Donachie and her husband have three other children, Samuel, seven, Amelia, two, and Isabella, who was born two weeks before her sister was killed.
(Donachie, three, Amelia, two, Isabella, two weeks)
Mrs Donachie formerly worked as an intensive therapy nurse and her husband works with an investment firm.
(Donachie,)
Olivia went to a nursery attached to Bonaly Primary School and was a healthy, confident, outgoing child, who had lots of friends.
(Olivia, Bonaly Primary School)
Inspector John Beresford, one of the officers who investigated Olivia's death, said outside court: "Daniel Jackson's actions were both criminally reckless and showed a total disregard for the safety of the public.
(John Beresford, one, Olivia, Daniel Jackson)
This sentence should send an extremely strong message to all road users who may consider driving while under the influence of drugs, those who fail to maintain their vehicles to the required standard and those who drive with utter disregard for the safety of the public.

A PRIEST who collaborated in murders, abductions and torture during the military dictatorship in Argentina has been sentenced to spend the rest of his life in prison.

But the court believed victims who said von Wernich listened to their confessions in prison, extracting the names of fellow left-wingers, then telling the police who arrested them and brought them in to be tortured.

The priest was described as an "interrogator in a cassock."

He also bolstered the morale of police who had crises of conscience after torture sessions.

Job fear for hundreds as legal aid system heads for meltdown
(hundreds,)
HUNDREDS of criminal-law firms in Scotland face financial ruin due to a massive shake-up in the way solicitors are paid and crimes are prosecuted, it was claimed last night.
(HUNDREDS, Scotland, last night)
The Scotsman can reveal the country's leading court solicitors believe radical proposals to overhaul legal-aid fees will drive the profession to breaking point.
(Scotsman,)
They claim the changes will force thousands of solicitors and support staff out of their jobs.
(thousands,)
Lawyers also warn the squeeze will lead to more miscarriages of justice as they will be forced to spend less time preparing individual cases.
()
The Scottish Government proposals, announced last month and due to be introduced in the spring, have dismayed the legal establishment.
(last month, the spring)
One lawyer suggested the profession is now "in the death throes."
(One,)
The Scottish Legal Aid Board believes the overhaul will result in some law firms losing as much as a quarter of their income - a scenario that solicitors say will drive hundreds out of business.
(The Scottish Legal Aid Board, hundreds)
Small city-based firms operated by a single lawyer will be worst-hit and stand to lose between 20 and 26 per cent of their revenue.
(between 20 and 26 per cent,)
Many bigger firms, whose business comes from representing people accused of crimes in court, are also facing hard times as a result of the moves.
()
However, a relatively small number of lawyers are expected to benefit financially.
()
Despite the warnings, opposition politicians last night welcomed the move to cut Scotland's £150 million annual legal-aid bill.
(last night, Scotland, £150 million, annual)
A complex raft of proposed changes to legal-aid fees - the biggest in over a decade - are intended to reflect a drive to speed up the justice system.
(a decade,)
Ministers are seeking quicker guilty pleas and the resolution of thousands of "low-level" cases, such as vandalism and breach of the peace, through fiscal fines and fixed-penalty notices, rather than ending up in court.
(thousands,)
But solicitors claim the reforms will have a devastating impact, causing a "brain drain" that will seriously damage the quality and standing of Scotland's legal profession.
(Scotland,)
Lawyers working in district and sheriff courts say that fees they are paid for most cases will drop from £500 to £300.
(£500 to £300,)
John Scott, whose Edinburgh-based firm faces losing £63,000 a year as a result of the changes, said: "These proposals, if they are followed through, will put thousands of lawyers and legal staff out of work.
(John Scott, Edinburgh, 63,000, thousands)
Fewer lawyers will have to carry out more work and that is likely to result in more miscarriages of justice.
()
He said access to justice will also be affected by further proposed changes to the system, which he said will require thousands of people accused of crimes, including assault and housebreaking, to pay for their own legal representation.
(thousands,)
Officials estimate the changes will slash approximately 7 per cent - or £4.5 million - from the bill for legal aid in district and sheriff-court cases.
(approximately 7 per cent, £4.5 million)
But Mr Scott, president of the Edinburgh Bar Association - which represents more than 100 solicitors - said: "We have hit crisis point.
(the Edinburgh Bar Association, more than 100)
These cuts will not just get rid of the flesh.
()
They will strike at the bone.
()
I cannot think of anything more damaging, short of scrapping the legal-aid system altogether.
()
This will reduce the profession to a level beneath which it cannot properly operate.
()
It will mean thousands of people will not be able to afford to be defended.
(thousands,)
Another solicitor, Patrick McCann, who runs his own firm in Limekilns, Fife, said the criminal legal profession was "in the death throes."
(Patrick McCann, Limekilns)
He added: "I think privately instructed criminal defence will be finished in five years."
(five years,)
Oliver Adair, convener of the Law Society of Scotland's legal-aid solicitors committee, said: "The society is aware of the dissatisfaction among criminal legal-aid practitioners about the proposed reforms.
(Oliver Adair, the Law Society, Scotland)
We believe they will not work - for practitioners or the public - as they will restrict access to justice.
()
But Bill Aitken, the Tory justice spokesman, said: "Lawyers need to remember we are dealing with taxpayers' money.
(Bill Aitken, Tory)
This is not a gravy train.
()
Paul Martin, for Scottish Labour, added: "We need value for money, but we also need a high-quality service."
(Paul Martin, Scottish Labour)
A Scottish Government spokesman said: "This is a genuine consultation - we will consider carefully what the profession and others say before finalising our proposals.
(Scottish Government,)
The system will be more efficient and we will ensure that there is confidence in the system for all users, and value for money.
()
He said only about 0.5 per cent of accused people would be disqualified from getting legal aid.

'If this goes through I'll have to shut'
()
DARK clouds are hovering above Andrew Gilbertson's office in Dalkeith main street.
(Andrew Gilbertson's, Dalkeith)
If these changes go through, I'll have to shut up shop.
()
There's no doubt about it," says the experienced court solicitor.
()
I'm the only defence agent in town.
()
But they won't be able to find me here much longer, by the looks of things.
()
The government's proposed changes, he says, will slash the amount he is paid for representing the bulk of his clients from £500 to £300.
(£500 to £300,)
My income will fall by 40 per cent.
(40 per cent,)
That's completely unsustainable.
()
The office will have to close and I'll have to make my two part-time secretaries redundant.
(two,)
Last year, his firm was paid £155,000 from the legal-aid board.
(Last year, 155,000)
But he says his outlays, including a mortgage for the office and staff salaries, leave him "constantly in overdraft."
()
"I'll try to keep going from home, with just a mobile and a laptop," added Mr Gilbertson.
(Gilbertson,)
What is legal aid?
()
Public money provided for people accused of crime, or those who seek recourse in the civil courts, to cover their legal costs.
()
More than £150 million was spent on legal aid last year.
(More than, last year)
What are the proposed legal-aid reforms?
()
Cases that are quickly concluded with a guilty plea will attract a higher fee for solicitors of either £200 for district-court cases or £300 for more serious sheriff-court cases.
(200, 300)
The current fee is £70.
(70,)
Lawyers also receive £500 for a case that starts with a not- guilty plea, but does not go trial.
(500,)
These are expected to dry up, resulting in a net loss of income.
()
What will the changes mean for lawyers?
()
Some are expected to gain, but the vast majority will lose out.
()
In the worst-case scenario, lawyers who work on their own will lose 26 per cent of their income.
(26 per cent,)
They warn that thousands of jobs, including solicitors and staff, will be shed.
(thousands,)
Should we believe these claims?
()
It is unlikely that thousands of jobs will go, although many lawyers are now seriously worried about the future.
(thousands,)
Why does this matter to the public?
()
Lawyers say they will have less time to spend on individual cases, raising the possibility that miscarriages of justice will occur.
()
There will also be a "brain drain," they warn, with talented young lawyers moving into more lucrative jobs.
()
What other changes are proposed?
()
The government wants to change the eligibility rules for legal aid, so those with savings of as little as just over £1,500 will have to pay for a lawyer.
(1,500,)
Currently, the threshold is £6,879.
(6,879,)
Lawyers say thousands of people will be affected.
(thousands,)
How many defence lawyers are there in Scotland?
(Scotland,)
There are about 600 firms, employing thousands of staff, and 1,500 solicitors, registered to carry out criminal legal-aid work.
(about 600, thousands, 1,500)
Why do ministers want to introduce the changes?
()
To provide better value for money to the taxpayer and make the criminal-justice system more efficient.
()
Officials estimate around £4.5 million will be saved from an annual summary-court legal-aid bill of about £65million
(£4.5 million, about £65million)
When will the changes be introduced?
()
The government says it intends to introduce reforms next spring, but insists it will listen to the concerns of lawyers.
(next spring,)
